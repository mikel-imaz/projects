## My Data Science projects
Here you will find my data science projects developed in Jupyter notebooks.  

They are basically Data Analysis, Machine Learning and AI projects using libraries and frameworks such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.

I have organized them into a Jupyter Book for easier reference. You can access the book at https://mikel-imaz.github.io/projects.
