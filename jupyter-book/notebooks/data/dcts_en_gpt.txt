Before leaving
On weekends I usually meet up with my father. First, we have a cortado and then a couple of drinks at the bars in town. That Saturday, the first day of September, I waited for the second small beer to tell him:
—I am going to do the Camino de Santiago.
—Don't bother me —he replied.
The truth is that I also didn't see it very clearly. But not so much because of walking the Camino itself, but because of doing something that didn't correspond to me at that moment. That's why it had been so hard for me to make a decision.
"My father added, 'Said like that, it seems like madness.'"
What he didn't know back then was that I had been preparing for it for quite some time. I had bought myself a new pair of sneakers and, during the summer, I had been going out for a walk with them daily. In addition, I had researched practical aspects on the internet and had also read a couple of books where the authors shared their experiences. But it wasn't until the last days of August that I went to the Decathlon store in San Sebastián to get the backpack and the rest of the equipment, and only then did I make it official: in September, I was walking to Santiago.
Those days I slept poorly. In the morning, I would wake up feeling like a wreck and, in the bathroom, with a sense of unreality, what I was about to do would come to mind: embark on a hassle of discomforts and leave my wife alone for a whole month. And I also felt guilty for what I was not going to do: look for a job and return to normality.
A few days before leaving, I approached the neighboring town of Beasain to get my pilgrim's credential, the document that would identify me as such. It was provided at the pilgrim's hostel in this municipality, because the so-called Camino Vasco del Interior passes through here, a route that starts in Irún, crosses Guipúzcoa, then Álava, and finally links up with the Camino de Santiago par excellence in La Rioja: the Camino Francés.
I had come up with an idea: taking advantage of the proximity of Beasain, about twelve kilometers away, I would walk to Santiago starting directly from my doorstep. I liked this plan, it would make my journey something special. It even seemed logical to consider it this way, although I didn't know of anyone from the town who had done the same.
That same afternoon I had received the following WhatsApp message from my father:
Hey, thinking about it and without wanting to meddle in other people's business, well, you must have thought it through, the first stretch, from here to Beasain, I don't know what makes it part of the Camino de Santiago. If you want, I could give you a ride in my car so you can start from there. Count on me. We'll talk later.
I replied the following:
The pilgrimage starts at home, so all the paths to Santiago are Jacobean. The difference is that the official ones are signposted, safe, and have hostels. Thank you anyway, we will be there.
At the hostel, I was assisted by the volunteer hospitalero on duty that day, a retiree who seemed happy to help me or to distract himself for a while, because it was very quiet. After all I had read, it was the first time I had direct contact with the reality of the Camino de Santiago and I felt somewhat nervous. But the hospitalero's good disposition encouraged me to ask him the questions I had noted down on my phone, various issues that had not been clear to me when preparing for the trip. I asked him:
—Is it advisable to bring a mat just in case?
Just as I said it, an alarm went off in my head: I had said "just in case." It had slipped out without me realizing it. The guides I had read all agreed that in the backpack you should only carry the essentials, and that excluded the "just in case," a telltale expression of fear. But the man didn't take advantage of the ball that I had left within reach and didn't score. He simply gave me his opinion, without being paternalistic. So, feeling confident, I continued asking: Was the mountain pass of Zegama well signposted? Were there pillows in the hostels? Did they usually fill up? Was it advisable to call ahead to announce our arrival?
"Come," he told me a little later, "I'm going to show you the bedroom so you can get an idea."
I accompanied him to a door that he opened, asking me to be silent. Inside, there was a row of unoccupied bunk beds (each with its corresponding pillow), but someone was resting at the back, so we didn't enter.
- She's a French pilgrim - the hospitalero whispered to me, closing the door carefully - She's seventy years old and, from what I understood because she doesn't speak Spanish, she's been walking from her home.
Returning to reception, I noticed that I had calmed down. They gave me the credential, a simple folded cardboard in the shape of a bellows with space for the stamps, which I filled out with my information. Next, they stamped my first seal on it and then escorted me outside. Upon leaving, I was surprised to find myself still in Beasain; it seemed like I had been in another world. We said goodbye.
"¡Buen Camino!" the man wished me, shaking my hand.
And so, yes, I felt the excitement that this was serious and I could now consider myself, too, a pilgrim.
Basque Way

01. Urretxu/Zumarraga - Beasain - Zegama (23.9 km)
How to leave my town was not something obvious. I was amazed that it had its complications, considering that leaving a place on your own two feet is such a basic action. I considered the possibility of going through the mountains, but I ruled it out as too convoluted and because of the slopes. There was no other option than the roadside.
At first, I didn't really mind the day, as long as it didn't rain. And seeing that the weather forecast was good for the weekend, I decided on Sunday because there would be less traffic on the road. In fact, it was a very good idea to go out on Sunday, because the streets would be deserted early in the morning and, in case someone saw me, they would think that with my backpack (although large) and my walking stick, I was going hiking in the mountains, as that was considered normal on a holiday.
My wife accompanied me on the journey to Beasain, then she would return by train. Once we had passed the first dangerous shoulder stretch, the rest could be done on the bidegorri, the parallel path intended for cyclists and pedestrians out for a walk. It was a beautiful summer morning and we chatted happily, as if we were taking one of our pleasant weekend walks. Although there was the backpack, pulling on my back with its eight kilos of weight, reminding me at times that this was different.
As we approached Beasain, with a pang in my chest, I realized that we would soon have to part ways. And that moment arrived quickly, as soon as we came across the first yellow arrow painted on a lamppost. It was time to say goodbye.
- You understand that I have to leave, right? I can't stay at home doing nothing.
My voice failed me, it broke. It wasn't the right moment, and besides, everything had already been said. But I couldn't think of anything else to say. We hugged, and my wife, who also seemed unable to speak, gently pushed me forward with her hand to make me leave. After a few steps, I turned around so she could take a picture of me and forced a smile. A few steps further, I turned around again, but she was walking away on the sidewalk and was already disappearing among the parked cars.
The following kilometers I did feeling very lonely and holding back the urge to cry. I searched with my eyes for the yellow arrows that marked the way. They were painted on the pavement, the lampposts, and the walls. I knew that place very well (I was passing in front of a shopping center where we used to shop), and yet, I had never noticed those signs before; I didn't even know, before starting all this, that the Camino de Santiago passed right there.
The arrows kept me company, nothing more, because I knew perfectly well where I had to go to get to Zegama. But at a certain point, they indicated a detour that I had not considered, it was through an industrial estate that I did not know. I hesitated whether to continue on familiar ground or to follow the signs. Finally, I followed the arrows and soon realized that they were avoiding a road crossing and leading me through a shorter path.
I had to follow the arrows, let myself be guided by them. That way I could stop worrying about planning the best route. I was no longer walking along the dangerous shoulder at the exit of my town, deciding whether to go right or left, alert in case a truck passed by my side. Now I was inside a safe route called "Camino de Santiago", with its infrastructure ready to help me. So, supposedly, my mind could stop worrying about some things and try to pay attention to others.
For example, my shadow. To protect myself from the sun, I had put on my hat, which, along with the bulge of the backpack and the hiking stick, projected a silhouette on the ground that seemed like that of a genuine pilgrim, with a cape and staff. That was me now. I took a picture of my shadow with the intention of posting it later on the internet, on the travel blog that I was going to share with my family.
I felt strange walking with those clothes because I didn't see any other pilgrim like me. That sunny Sunday morning, I crossed paths on the bike path with retirees in tracksuits, families with children on bicycles, and middle-aged runners. I moved forward leaning heavily on the cane. In reality, I didn't really know what to do with this accessory, and since I was carrying it, it seemed to me that I had to use it or at least pretend to.
I had managed to shake off the sadness and was doing fine, although I could feel the tiredness from the walk. And there was a moment, as I was getting closer to the end, when I even got scared when I noticed the pressure my feet were under. Suddenly, I felt them as if they were being crushed inside my shoes. I realized that carrying eight kilos on my back (compared to the sixty-five I weigh) was no joke, at least not after a certain number of steps taken.
Because that was another thing: it was the first time I had walked so much in a row. My previous preparation during the summer had consisted of daily marches of five kilometers, ten sometimes. And always without weight, I refused to exercise with a backpack full of potatoes. Because in this regard, I had decided to believe in something I had read somewhere and liked for its elemental simplicity: that true learning and training occurred during the course of the Camino itself. There was no need to obsess.
I arrived in Zegama in the early afternoon. In a park at the entrance, I ate the tortilla sandwich I had brought from home. Then I went to the village inn to get my credential stamped and, along with the paper sheets, to be given the keys to access the hostel, located in the schools. I thought I would probably be alone, but I found the door open and inside there was a man lying on one of the bunk beds, a guy with grayish hair combed and a trimmed beard, who sat up to introduce himself. It was Toni.
"I have also thought that I would be alone," he told me.
From Irún, he had walked alongside another pilgrim, but that same morning his companion had to abandon the journey and return home because his feet were blistered.
The shelter had been improvised in a gym with very high ceilings. There were a handful of bunk beds scattered in the middle of the court, as if playing a match among themselves. I spread out my sleeping bag on a bed that was at a safe distance from Toni's and went to take a shower.
Upon returning, I noticed that the man wanted to chat. He seemed bored, with nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon in Zegama after completing his stage practically without breaking a sweat. We exchanged some basic information and I retired to my bunk to write in my notebook the day's impressions. After a while, I heard by his breathing that he had fallen asleep. Later on, I also dozed off.
When I woke up, he was no longer there. I went out for a walk and soon ran into him on the street. We sat down at a terrace to have a beer.
Toni liked to chat. He was from Barcelona. He dressed a bit like me, from Decathlon, and perhaps because of that and his grace when moving, he didn't look like the sixty-one years he was. He was retired, he said, which allowed him to dedicate himself to walking the Camino de Santiago throughout the year. He had lost track of the exact number of times he had completed it on its different routes, although the Basque Way was the first time he was walking it.
I remained cautious without giving away too many details about myself, although I soon realized that the conversation with Toni was safe because he didn't stray from the topic.
—"And how are you feeling after the first day, do you have any pain?" she asked me.
—I'm just beat. And my shoulder hurts, it really hurts. I don't know if I might have tied the backpack straps too tight.
"It's normal to feel discomfort during the first few days, until the body gets used to the weight," she said, exercising her shoulders up and down and in circular motions. "Does one shoulder bother you more than the other?"
—Yes, it's the right one that hurts me.
—Have you carried the cane in your right hand?
Indeed, that was the reason, because of the tension with which I had grabbed it and leaned it on the floor. Oh my, I was so tense.
A little dog approached us sniffing around the corners of the terrace. Toni reached into his jacket and pulled out a water gun, which he then aimed at the animal. The dog stared at him, unfazed. In the end, he didn't shoot, although he could have, as the gun, a transparent plastic one, was filled with water.
"To scare away the dogs is the best thing there is," he said, putting on a voice, and started laughing by himself as he placed the gun on the table.
The little dog went on his way without understanding anything, just like me. In the literature about the Camino, it was a recurring theme, the precautions to be taken for dogs that could bite walkers in the mountains. But I saw this more as a danger from other times, not from the present.
—Besides, if necessary, that's what the cane is for, right? —I added.
—The walking stick also serves to check the step before putting your foot in a muddy puddle, which is something appreciated when wearing sneakers. What brand are yours?
They were simple, breathable Salomon shoes. Apparently, they were good for doing the Camino de Santiago at that time, and I was relieved to hear him say that because I had bought everything quite cheaply from Decathlon and I was afraid that, in front of experienced pilgrims like Toni, it would be obvious that I had no clue. But he had also equipped himself at the same store, so I felt reassured in this aspect.
We kept chatting over a second beer and later had some tapas for dinner. At one point, Toni gave the water gun to a child who was playing around there; apparently, it had been given to him that morning by the colleague who had to leave.
We returned to the shelter, and I stayed outside to make a call and chat with my wife for a while. When I finished, it was not yet completely dark. I looked towards the imposing slope of the Aizkorri massif, which rose like a dark cloud above my head. The next day, I would ascend the mountainside, although I wasn't sure about it: if the first stage, very easy, had left me exhausted, how would I fare in the second, much tougher one?
The previous week, in order to inspect the terrain and thus calm my unease, I had thought about driving there, to Zegama, and going on an excursion following the same route. But no, I resisted it just like the exhaustive training in the previous weeks. Those actions had tempted me as a way to control the risk and ensure success in this endeavor. However, by doing them, I was risking killing the reason why I set out in the first place.
I didn't want to use the trip to feel good about having completed it (another point for my resume), adding flirtatiously that I had left from home and, who knows, maybe even finishing it in less time than usual. No, for once in my life I wanted to approach it differently, because otherwise, I knew what would happen: I wouldn't learn anything truly valuable.
I thought I had prepared myself enough so that the journey wouldn't become burdensome for me or risk me abandoning it due to being out of shape or lack of foresight. And from here, I wanted to leave room for uncertainty. Because this time, instead of pushing myself, what I intended was to accompany myself and have the opportunity to live with my fears. I counted on them not overwhelming me and being able to be present, because there was a reason why I hadn't gone on an adventure, but rather something much more moderate like the Camino de Santiago. That was my idea.
Toni had already gone to bed, so I also got into my sleeping bag. It was strange to be there, trying to fall asleep in the middle of a school gym, sharing that space with a stranger. My house was just twenty kilometers away, but everything had changed. Suddenly, I had lost the comforts and, precisely because of that, I no longer had time to worry about my medium-term future. Now I needed to take care of a more immediate tomorrow, of resting, eating, lodging, and moving forward paying attention to what was happening to me, day after day. In the background, the goal was clear: Santiago. And that, despite everything, gave me a sense of calm, of feeling that, having taken a path, at least I had the next few weeks sorted out.



In Beasain, in front of the yellow arrow (painted on the lamppost), I say goodbye to K. These are my first steps on the Basque Way. How many times have I passed by here and never noticed these discreet signs. From now on, they will be my daily bread.



Bike path to Zegama and the imposing Aizkorri massif looking down at me from up there. It seems like it's laughing at me for what awaits me tomorrow. I'm not entirely confident because I've never walked so much or with such a heavy backpack.
02. Zegama — Salvatierra-Agurain (21.9 km)
I slept terribly at the Zegama gym. I wanted to rest well because the second stage was going to be very tough with the climb to Mount Aizkorri and passing through the San Adrián tunnel. But the unease about the journey that had just begun and having a stranger sleeping nearby unsettled me. I regretted taking a nap. I heard the hours chime very late from the bells of two churches, the farthest one was delayed. At some point, I fell asleep, but then I woke up several times during the rest of the night.
Around seven, I was woken up by Toni's movements as he packed his backpack. I got up and started gathering my things as well, taking my time so he could leave first because I preferred to go alone.
"I'll see you later in Salvatierra, as I'm going slowly," I said when I saw him hesitating about whether to wait for me or not.
I went to the inn to return the hostel keys. I walked into the bar saying "Good morning!" energetically (which even surprised me with its sound) and ordered a coffee with milk. I felt clear-headed and strong, something that had happened to me on other occasions after a bad night before an important event. Adrenaline (or whatever it was) made sure that in the morning I felt in good spirits.
When leaving the bar, I had to continue down a narrow street where there was a traffic light to regulate the alternating passage of vehicles. A van loaded with workers who were going to work on some construction site stopped. I remembered it was Monday. The traffic light turned green and I also started moving.
Leaving the town behind, the road turned into a narrow path invaded by nettles (Toni, who was wearing shorts, later told me that he had a really tough time here). I was walking along the course of a river when I startled a wading bird that took off as soon as it saw me. Shortly after, passing by a farmhouse, a sign read "Beware of the dog," although the animal was asleep and all it did when it sensed me was lift an eyelid.
I tackled the daunting ascent up the mountainside. The steep slope forced me to walk leaning forward. It was cloudy and silent, with no wind. Suddenly, I heard a very loud noise, like that of a rock avalanche. I stopped in fear. Then I remembered that I was right above the tunnels through which the trains of the Madrid-Irún railway line circulate, entering and exiting the mountain in that area as if they were moles.
A little further on, the path began to zigzag along the slope and the incline relaxed a bit. In some short stretches, it even became flat, and in those moments, a joy came over me that caught me off guard. It seemed to be due to the momentary relaxation of the effort, a kind of message that the body sent to the brain, saying, "This is going well, buddy, we're making it." At a certain moment, I looked up and saw the figure of someone who was watching me from above some rocks. It must have been Toni, so, in order not to catch up with him, I pretended not to have seen him and stopped to rest and eat some nuts.
With the height, the fog was coming in, but it didn't alarm me because the signage was very good, just as the hospitalero from Beasain had assured me. Every time I reached a crossroads, there were the yellow arrows waiting for me, on official signs or painted on rocks or beech tree trunks. Furthermore, if by mistake I took the wrong path, another yellow sign immediately appeared, this one in the shape of an X or cross, warning of the mistake made. It was magnificent, who could go through life like that.
I was already at a considerable height when a hermitage took shape in the fog. Further on, I heard a bell. But it wasn't until I had them in front of me that I saw the mare and her foal, which trotted up to me. I petted them and searched for my phone in my fanny pack to take a picture. While I was doing that, the foal sniffed my arm and then bit it, but without applying pressure, I don't know if it was playing or trying to figure out how my jacket tasted. It accompanied me for a stretch and then returned to its mother.
I must have been getting close to the San Adrián tunnel. Despite the poor visibility, I recognized the path from other occasions when I had been there on a hike, as a child or, more recently, with my wife. Those times it had been easier to access that environment, first by car along a track that left you nearby, to then walk a bit and visit the cave. But now the feeling was different because, for the first time, I was going to use the tunnel "for real", as I needed it to cross to the other side of the mountain just like merchants, travelers, and pilgrims did in the past coming and going from Castile.
I crossed the natural cave and continued along the remains of the medieval road, paying attention to the ground so as not to stumble over the limestone boulders. Then a human being appeared. I instinctively felt close to that young man who was running towards me, as we found ourselves in such a lonely place and I hadn't crossed paths with anyone in the last few hours. He was perfectly equipped for a mountain race (trail running), he seemed to be training. But I don't think he even saw me as he passed by my side, so focused on where to step among the stones. In that ghostly mist, it was as if to doubt my own existence.
The sun cleared up as soon as I started descending the other side of the mountain. In the distance, among the oak treetops, the ochre tones of the fields of Álava began to be visible. I felt exhilarated. Even though on the way down I noticed more clearly the weight of the backpack and the pressure on my feet. But, strangely, it didn't seem as threatening anymore because the first obstacle had been overcome and I wasn't going to have to turn back home at the first sign of trouble. That would have been too humiliating. That danger was what had truly unsettled me the day and night before. And to rule out any possibility in this regard, I sat on a rock to change my socks. I had to take care of my feet, having them wet from sweat increased the likelihood of blisters and I didn't want to end up like Toni's friend, the one with the water gun, who had to go back home with his feet all torn up.
It was past two o'clock when I arrived at the first village, Zalduondo. I sat in the shade of a chestnut tree next to a fountain with several spouts and took out the only thing I had left to eat from my backpack, some cheese and bread. A young man appeared who had come to fill a water bottle.
"Are you going to Santiago?" she asked me with a smile.
The expression on his face, I recognized it immediately, was one of pleasure at having the opportunity to speak with someone who was going on a trip far away from there.
—Where are you from?
Beasain, I said, to keep it simple. From the other side of the mountain, quite close therefore. And yet, I had the impression that it was coming from very far away, perhaps because of the drastic change that had occurred in the landscape. Crossing Aizkorri, I had left behind the green and humid Guipúzcoa, and now I found myself among fields more typical of Castilla and the imagery that I associated with the Camino de Santiago. I think it was in this brief conversation with the young man when I finally believed it. By crossing the mountain and leaving behind the usual setting of my life, I felt more confident. I had already set off and, yes, I could say it without hesitation: I was heading to Santiago.
I arrived in Salvatierra around four in the afternoon, via a very lightly traveled road, being careful not to lean on the cane, although luckily, I no longer felt any pain in my shoulder. At the municipal sports center, they stamped my credential and gave me a key to access the hostel, which this time was set up in a small building that had been the changing room for the adjacent soccer field.
"Spectacular tour, huh?" Toni wanted to share when I walked in through the door.
—Yes, well, I already knew about it —I said, I don't know why, dampening his enthusiasm.
He had been settled in for a while, showered and combed. It seemed like we were going to be alone again, so I chose my bunk in the other small room of the two available. I placed the paper sheets they had given me on the mattress and pillow, spread out the sleeping bag, and started the routine of tasks that I would always repeat upon arriving at the hostels: shaving, showering, putting cream on my feet, washing my clothes, and hanging them to dry. Then I was free. In the hallway, there were a series of lockers inherited from when it used to function as a dressing room, and since the rooms were very narrow, I put my backpack and belongings in one of them, inserted a coin into the slot, and turned the key.
"Are you locking up and everything, huh?" Toni said to me, with a teasing tone.
I was right, that had been ugly, as if I didn't trust him. But it had just come out automatically, I wasn't thinking about what I was doing; and now, it was me who felt offended, by the way he had said it to me. Annoyed, I took back the coin, leaving the key in its place, in the open locker. I lay down on the bunk to rest and write in the notebook. Thank goodness I had my own room.
But a while later, two pairs of sweaty French retirees appeared. Toni, always very attentive to social issues, didn't have them under control because, apparently, they had also come from Irun but in previous stages they had stayed in hostels. I changed bunk beds to leave them alone in a room, sharing Toni's. Once they had settled in, one of the French women, the only one who spoke some English in the group, peeked into our door:
—Are you angry? —he asked us with a smile: "Are you upset?".
Did we stand out that much? And what was that all about, and with that little smile on top of it?
"What does it say?" Toni asked me, who didn't know English, sitting up in his bunk.
I ignored Toni's question because the situation had unsettled me, and I told the woman that no, not at all. Then, when she offered us some pastries they had bought at a bakery on the way to Salvatierra, still smiling, I realized that, being a good Frenchwoman, she was unable to pronounce the aspirated 'h' correctly and instead of saying "angry," what she had meant to say was "hungry," to see if we were hungry.
"Thank you," Toni said, quickly getting up to grab a pastry.
I was left without mine because I had already told her no. She left us alone in the room again, accompanied by an uncomfortable silence that seemed deafening to me. Toni got ready and left for the street without saying anything to me. Then I also went out, to see if I could get over the upset.
Among the expectations I had before embarking on the trip was to spend some time in the afternoons doing a bit of sightseeing in the towns, but from the first day I realized that I had hardly any time left. In Salvatierra, the only thing I visited was a Dia supermarket and a bar, both located in front of the hostel. In the supermarket, I saw Toni, buying some ready-made food for dinner like me. At the checkout, we waited for each other and when we left, we suggested having a beer. The beer brought us together.
- Do you know? These French people are not the only ones; we have someone else following our path at our level.
He waited for me to ask, "Oh really?"
—Yes, he caught up with me in the San Adrián tunnel while I was resting. He's a man from Madrid staying at a hotel," he said somewhat disdainfully. "When I mentioned that you were following behind, he said he did indeed see you climbing up.
I remembered the mysterious figure of the guy who was watching me from some rocks as I climbed. Then I saw him too, I thought, mistakenly believing it was Toni. But between one thing and another, I didn't say anything to him and pretended not to have seen him; just in case, so as not to mess things up, in case, for not having told him right away, he suspected that I was hiding something from him and in some unexpected way offended him again.



Taking a trip on foot is not the same as going for a walk. I had previously walked through the San Adrián tunnel, but I had never felt the authenticity of this time. This time it wasn't just a visit. I really needed to use the tunnel to cross to the other side of the mountain, reach the plains of Álava, and continue my journey.
03. Salvatierra-Agurain — Vitoria-Gasteiz (27.8 km)
I slept well.
—Yes, it has already been noticed —Toni blurted out as we got up.
Apparently, he had snored. I felt bad for bothering him, but that wasn't the way to handle it, he could have told me in a different way. Besides, how much had he snored? A lot, a little? In any case, there was no time to dwell on this matter, I had to get going.
It was still night and there was fog. The bar across the street was closed, so I decided to keep going, thinking I would find another place to have breakfast. Guided by the signs, I passed through an industrial estate with large warehouses and heavy traffic, and then I ventured into the countryside along a dirt and gravel track, leaving behind the hustle and bustle and being left alone with the sound of my footsteps. Toni caught up with me, whom I had left breakfasting at the hostel a little earlier. "See you later," he said as he passed me. He was slightly shorter than me, but much stronger in build. He walked with determination, holding the walking stick in his right hand without leaning on it, like a lance ready for battle, swinging back and forth to the rhythm of his progress, one, two, one, two. He soon disappeared into the fog.
With the daylight everything turned whiter. The track crossed plowed fields and beyond a few dozen meters nothing could be seen. I stopped for a moment and, as the noise of my steps on the gravel ceased, I felt a great stillness. With that whiteness, it was as if I were wrapped in cotton wool. A little further on, the road disappeared swallowed by the fog and it was not possible to see where it was leading me. And yet, it was pleasant to move towards the unknown in that way.
During the summer, in the weeks leading up to my departure, I had set out to prepare the trip in all its details. I started by analyzing each stage, the interesting places I would pass through. It was important to select the hostels where I would stay, make sure they were good, that they had good reviews on the internet from users. I wanted to have everything written down. But I got tired and left it for when my exhaustive research reached the height of León, about two weeks into the journey. So much work without even knowing if I would make it there was a bit absurd. And when I abandoned this task, I realized the importance of the trip being long and, therefore, difficult to control in advance in all its aspects. It offered me the opportunity to accept a certain amount of uncertainty as an integral part of it. In a way, on my way to Vitoria, it was as if the visibility of those tens of meters ahead of me was what was planned. The rest remained behind the thick veil of fog and I would discover it as I progressed.
Because also, after looking it up so much for these first days, I hadn't even considered that, at this stage, in the small villages I would pass through, there wouldn't be a single bar where I could have a coffee with milk. In one of them, I went into the church's entrance and, lacking anything else, I enjoyed a breakfast that consisted of a handful of nuts with bottled water.
I rejoined the path just as the two pairs of French retirees we had shared the hostel with were passing by in front of me. They were really moving at a good pace! But I wasn't going to be left behind, so I quickened my step to keep up with them. They seemed to know about trekking, handling the two walking sticks each of them carried with good technique. They were definitely not out for a leisurely stroll; they were on a proper march. Sometimes two of them would walk side by side, chatting, but as soon as one fell behind for some reason (like a steep incline, for example), the other wouldn't wait and each would continue at their own pace, only to maybe catch up again later. It was like a cyclist "drafting" behind the one leading, or perhaps less dynamic, like trucks moving indifferently, each maintaining their speed in the parallel lanes of a highway.
The fog had already cleared and the sky was clear. I was surprised when Toni came up from behind; apparently, he had an urgent matter to attend to and had deviated a kilometer to a slightly larger town, Alegría-Dulantzi, to take care of it in a bar and have a coffee in the meantime. When he caught up with me, he matched his speed to mine to tell me that, after passing me early in the morning, he had also overtaken the man from Madrid, "but you can't imagine how hard it was, he was flying." Since he was eager to catch up with him, he said he was going to try to chase him down again. I started to mention the extraordinary pace of the French retirees who were still ahead, but just then Toni suddenly stopped to adjust his shoes and I didn't wait for him, but kept walking at my own pace as I had learned to do, leaving myself with the words on my lips. Next, Toni shot forward and passed all of us like a flash.
In one of the following villages, the French stopped for lunch and finally I was able to leave them behind. Further on, I began to glimpse in the distance the figure of someone walking with two sticks. He appeared and disappeared among the undulations of the terrain. It must have been the man from Madrid. I quickened my pace to get closer, but the distance between us seemed insurmountable. Sometimes I saw him distorted by the refraction of the hot air over the heated ground. In the end, I gave up and stopped to rest.
The stage was starting to feel long, I could feel the tiredness. It was noon and the sun was beating down. And on top of that, I had a headache: I was missing my daily dose of caffeine. Then, after several kilometers, as I reached the top of a hill, the skyscrapers of Vitoria appeared in the distance. "Victory!" I sang. I thought it would be a piece of cake, that I would soon reach the city. However, as would happen to me on other similar occasions during the journey, I fell victim to a psychological effect that occurs when the end of a stage is in sight: the goal seems close and, therefore, the last kilometers seem longer. With the heat and the desert landscape of the fields, civilization was like a mirage that never seemed to be reached.
I met Toni again, he was sitting in the shade on a bench in the last village just before entering the municipal area of Vitoria. It seemed to me that he was waiting for me. He said there was no trace of the person from Madrid, as if he had vanished. At that point, I wasn't even sure if I had seen him, maybe it had been a vision, because my senses were dulled. We started walking together, as I knew the city and it would be easier to reach the hostel. However, Toni kept walking fast, without me realizing he was setting a fast pace that I could barely keep up with. But at the same time, I also wanted to arrive as soon as possible and I was enjoying seeing myself capable of keeping up with him. When we reached the outskirts, the fast pace became frantic, we were about to start running, crossing avenues with the pedestrian traffic light on red, until suddenly I felt a pinch somewhere on my left foot and said to myself, "Enough!" What the hell was I doing? I sat on the step of a doorway and asked Toni to continue to the hostel without me.
—But are you okay?
—Yes, I'm fine, I just need to rest for a bit and find somewhere to grab a bite to eat.
-We should exchange phone numbers, just in case.
I procrastinated, we would see each other later, no big deal. When I saw that he had left, I waited a few more minutes before getting back on my feet. False alarm, everything seemed to be in order. I went into a hypermarket and bought a packaged salad and a bottle of fresh water. I ate sitting in a park, taking my time to recover. Then I continued without haste until I reached the hostel, located in the Old Town.
In the afternoon, after shaving, showering, applying cream to my feet, doing the laundry, and hanging it out to dry, I didn't lay down to rest in the bunk. I put on my casual clothes (identical pants and shirt to my work attire) and my sandals, and told Toni that I had plans with a friend who lived in the city. I headed straight to the Artium, to the Museum of Contemporary Art. There, in its cozy modern air-conditioned cafeteria, I looked for a table next to an outlet to charge my phone, ordered a latte and a croissant, and took out the notebook I had with me from my bag. I started writing, enjoying the comfortable seat and every sip of coffee. Chill-out music was playing. I was glad I hadn't given Toni my phone number, feeling unreachable in those moments. I stayed there for a while, over an hour, lingering, trying to regain my tone, using the notebook as a means to reconnect with myself. And I remember asking myself the inevitable question that apparently every pilgrim asks themselves at some point during the journey: Who sent me to walk the Camino de Santiago?



On my way to Vitoria, Toni overtakes me and then I am left alone. I stopped for a moment and, as the noise of my steps on the gravel suddenly ceased, I felt a great stillness. It was like being wrapped in cotton wool. Before me, the road disappeared swallowed by the fog and I couldn't see where it was leading me. But it was pleasant.

04. Vitoria-Gasteiz — La Puebla de Arganzón (18.8 km)
In Vitoria, the hostel was actually a youth hostel and we had to share a room with some young people who went to bed late after going out in the Old Town. In addition to the noises and snoring, I was kept awake by the loud voices of someone talking in their sleep. From a certain hour in the early morning, I kept waking up repeatedly, checking the time on my phone each time. Until finally it was six o'clock, a reasonable time to get up and make some noise while packing up. When I breathed in the tranquility of the street, it felt like a liberation.
Toni stayed at the hostel having breakfast with what he had in his backpack, and it wasn't hard for me to find an open café to recover. I had a slice of Spanish omelette with a latte while watching the city wake up from my table by the window. I felt like a weirdo with my traveler look, especially when two executives in suits and ties came in and had espresso at the counter. An hour later, when I left the place, I faced the hustle and bustle, people rushing to their jobs and kids going to school on their first days of the term. Walking along avenues with a wide pedestrian walk in the middle, I looked for the tiles with a scallop shell engraving that indicated the way out of Vitoria. I was sure that only I could see them. I walked against the flow, as most people were heading towards the center. Perhaps because they were half asleep, no one seemed to notice me, as if I were in one of those restless dreams with many people for whom I was invisible. But I told myself that, like them, I was also undertaking a task, a job that in my case simply consisted of walking.
In a residential area on the outskirts, a small monolith indicated that there were 630 kilometers left to Santiago. Quite a distance. At the moment of taking the photo, I accidentally captured in the image two girls who had gone out for a run in the morning, and I felt like them, with the motivation that returning from vacation provides (at least during the first few days) to undertake a new purpose in life.
The stage was short compared to the previous day, and I decided to go alone, without falling into the trap of keeping up with others. And since I didn't come across anyone, not Toni, not the French, not the person from Madrid, I walked calmly along paths that ran through mown fields and low mountains. Climbing a hill on a trail, I surprised a bird of prey a few meters away from me, which took flight upon seeing me and began to glide over the valley. And a little further on, a deer that was in the middle of the field hurried to take refuge in a grove by hopping. In the three small villages (or rather hamlets) I passed through, I also didn't see anyone.
In the online guide of the Camino de Santiago that I was consulting on my phone (www.gronze.com), I read that in La Puebla de Arganzón, to access the hostel, you had to ask for Mr. Vicente (just like that, no last name) at the Ansotegui bar. Right there, I met up with Toni, who had arrived a while earlier and had been told to wait a bit, that Vicente was not there at the moment but would be back soon. We ordered a small beer.
"Another stage," Toni said, clinking our glasses together.
I drank it all in one gulp. The beer was so good that I took a picture of the plain glass that I returned to the bar.
Mr. Vicente, a cheerful and chubby man who seemed to have just come back from the orchard, asked us to accompany him. It wasn't easy to understand him because, in addition to being out of breath, he stumbled over his words and didn't speak clearly. He led us to what must have been the teacher's house in the past: a simple village house next to the school, with small rooms full of beds. Vicente explained everything about the facilities to us and finally pointed out where the donation box was.
—Yes, calm down Vicente —Toni told him to make him see that with people like us there was no need to remind him, because we were true trustworthy pilgrims.
Wow, how dangerous it was to leave it in the hands of each person's conscience. It was the first "donation-based" hostel I stayed at; in the previous ones, the modest price of a few euros was set and paid in advance.
I shaved, showered, put cream on my feet, washed and hung the clothes, and after eating a packaged pasta salad that I had bought the day before in Vitoria and resting a bit in bed, in the afternoon I started writing in my notebook on the table in the kitchen.
"But what are you writing, man, your memoirs?" Toni blurted out as soon as he showed up there after taking his little nap.
He also carried a small Moleskine-type diary in which he used to telegraphically jot down the stage data and how it had gone for him. The thing was that Toni would breeze through it in a few minutes as just another task ("my homework," he called it), while he would see me spending time completing several pages of my spiral notebook.
"I jot down my impressions," I said dryly, a little annoyed at having lost my train of thought.
But it seemed like he didn't understand, because he sat on one of the chairs in front of me and kept talking to me. In addition, shortly after, the French retirees accompanied by Vicente appeared. It was clear that I wouldn't be able to concentrate, so I closed the notebook and suggested to Toni to go to the grocery store to do the shopping.
The Ansotegui was a bar and also a grocery store, with separate spaces but attended by the same staff. As we gathered things for dinner and for the next day's journey, we saw Vicente returning to this "his office," the place where he supposedly spent his idle hours. As we left with our bags, we found him sitting on the bench attached to the wall of the bar, with one arm resting on a barrel and the other on the backrest. He started talking to us and we approached him. He wanted to chat with us for a bit, it was clear that he enjoyed interacting with pilgrims, perhaps more than with his neighbors.
Toni and I had some small beers, he didn't want us to treat him to anything. He told us that many people had passed through there doing the Camino de Santiago.
—And you've never done it, Vicente?
He smiled and, touching his bulging belly with both hands, came to tell us something like: "But do you see me doing it with this appearance?". No, he had never left the town and at sixty years old he wasn't going to do it now. But he had met a lot of people, many foreigners; he had spoken with more foreigners than anyone in the town: French, Germans, Chinese, you name it.
—Up to two Moors passed by here once.
—But that can't be true, Vicente.
And there we go again with "Vicente", time and time again we added his name as a tagline, how easy it is to fall into condescension when the opportunity arises.
—It can't be that they were Moors, remember the story of Santiago Matamoros —I said, trying to sound clever.
—Yes, I'm telling you.
We had dinner early at the hostel, meal times had clearly become European for us. Then we went out for a walk. It was getting dark after such a good day and the terraces in the square were full of people. We went once again to Ansotegui and there was Vicente, although he was already going home, as if he had finished his day. However, we stayed a few more minutes with him while we had our first "zurito" of the night. From the looks we were getting, I could tell we were drawing the attention of the regulars.
"What a drag he's given you, huh?" said a shady-looking guy who turned towards us from the bar when Vicente left. "Have you figured anything out yet? Because, let me tell you, you can't understand a damn thing from him."
With a shiny earring in his ear and the eyes of a drunk on his face, he was having a drink, a cola mixed drink. We kind of nodded, turning our backs on him. However, the man didn't want to let us go, he asked us where we were from. I started to be on guard as we ignored him. He raised his voice:
—Damn it! What's going on? You listen to him and not to me?
My heart started beating strongly as I watched Toni turn towards him to confront him.
—Let's see, what do you want? —she said defiantly.
But everything came to nothing because a friend of his appeared on the scene, with a smile that seemed to say "don't pay any attention to him," grabbed the tough guy and turned him back towards the counter. I would have liked to leave, but Toni ordered another round.
"Bring us two more small beers, please," he said to the waitress in a deeper voice than his usual one.
The girl smiled at us as she served us the small beers, and I thought that after what had happened, it would have been appropriate to order some proper pints. I liked the firmness Toni had shown. If necessary, I'm sure he would have defended Vicente as one of our own, there was a kind of spirit of unity among us, a "For the Camino!"
At the end of the round, we left the bar to go back to the hostel. We were leaving behind the still crowded terrace tables when I heard someone whistling at us and gesturing from the other side of the square, asking us to wait for him. It was a tall man, with a bushy mustache and frameless glasses, who walked as if stepping on eggs. I didn't recognize him. I noticed his leather strap sandals, his feet very well-aired.
"I'm staying here," he said, pointing with his hand at the Arganzón Plaza hotel, whose facade resembled a manor house illuminated by spotlights.
I understood that he was the man from Madrid, I was finally going to meet him. He was dressed casually, but not in the current sporty fashion, as he was wearing a khaki-colored shirt and long pants with many side pockets, an outfit reminiscent of an adventurer that brought to mind Miguel de la Quadra-Salcedo, not only because of his mustache, but also because of his clear diction and polite manner.
His name was Julio and he was "hotel hopping," but he was eager to share a few minutes of conversation with pilgrims like us. I pictured him at the end of the stage, filling the bathtub in his room at the Arganzón Plaza with hot water and then having dinner à la carte at his restaurant. But he needed to talk about how things were going for him and find out about those who were walking the same route as him. The three of us remained standing and talking for a while, as if isolated in a bubble in the middle of the square. Like Toni, Julio was an experienced walker, although on this journey his feet were in bad shape. He said he had made a mistake with his footwear: instead of new and slightly worn sneakers, he had brought along other very comfortable ones that he was fond of but were worn out. In any case, he had come to walk only the Basque Way and he had only two stages left, so he was going to finish it no matter what.
—But you can't be doing that bad, on the way to Vitoria it seemed to me that you were going like a locomotive —I said.
—Yes, it's true, I got carried away seeing that I could keep up the pace, but today I've paid for it.
He admitted that he was addicted to the endorphins that the body produces when adapting to intense effort continuously. He said that this was explained very well in a book he had read in French a few years ago. It sounded familiar to me.
"Could it be by any chance The Immortal Way?" I asked him. It was one of the two books I had read that summer as preparation for the trip.
—Indeed, Immortelle randonnée —he pronounced in perfect French—, I didn't know it had been translated.
His author was named Jean Christophe Rufin, a high-class diplomat and renowned French writer. I had read him with interest, although his gaze seemed a bit lofty to me; like Julio, he also did not want to have anything to do with sleeping in pilgrim hostels. I wondered if they knew each other.
We were still standing, but I wasn't getting tired. I felt delighted by the conversation we were having with this Julio, who had the gift of gab and enjoyed savoring experiences, both the ones he shared and the ones he listened to from others. We agreed to have a glass of wine together the next day in Haro. And when we said goodbye, I realized that we hadn't even agreed on where or at what time.
05. La Puebla de Arganzón - Haro (30.1 km)
We had been told that there was a bakery-café opening at seven in the morning at the exit of La Puebla. And there I showed up minutes before that time, after having slept well, ready to help them raise the metal shutter if necessary. I wanted to have breakfast and get going as soon as possible, because the stage was long and tough, according to the guide. Already seated at a table with my café au lait and toast, I was watching the news on TV. In four days of travel, I had completely lost track of current events and what they were saying seemed foreign to me.
Then Toni came in and ordered an Americano coffee and a croissant.
—But hadn't you already had breakfast at the hostel? —I asked him.
He smiled, shrugging his shoulders. As he confessed to me later, he was one of those who returned home from these trips with a few extra pounds (something that, on the other hand, I was sure wouldn't happen to me).
We set off together but separately. I warned him: "Each to his own, you're going to distract me." In any case, it was a stage where we had each other in sight for a good part of the journey. Toni seemed calmer, and in fact, at one point I left him behind in an almond grove, picking almonds and cracking them with stones. Later, he overtook me when I had to step aside to put a band-aid on a blister (first foot incident).
We passed through several of those villages where a few elderly people with walking sticks gather in the sun in the squares. Accessing a town like this, on foot from the countryside or coming down from the mountain, gave me a sensation as if I were a traveler from another time. Among the houses in the town center, my walking stick (which was already learning to lean without tensing my arm) sounded different against the pavement, with some echo in the first deserted streets. I used to play by pushing it so that the rubber tip bounced off the ground, making more noise to mark my steps. I felt special when saying good morning to the locals, as if what I was doing was "serious", not just a simple excursion. Some identified us as pilgrims and wished us a "Buen Camino," like a cyclist who saw me from the road and, raising his arm high, shouted, "Buen Camino, pilgrim!" It was not uncommon for a car to honk at you as it passed by. In these effusive greetings, I imagined that the simple fact of seeing me had instantly brought back memories of their own experience of the Camino de Santiago to some, and that it must have been a good one.
To the town of Salinillas de Buradón, Toni and I finally arrived together, and since there was a bar, we decided to have a drink before tackling the daunting climb to Portillo de la Lobera. I was thirsty and ordered a large beer ("cañón"), while Toni struggled mightily not to order the same accompanied by one of the tempting snacks that were winking at him from the counter. He managed to resist the temptation and joined me at the table with just an Americano coffee. We did share some nuts that I had in my backpack, though.
When we set off again, we ran into Julio, the man from Madrid, who had just arrived and was resting on one of the benches at the exit of the village. He was wearing a khaki visor cap, with a hanging back brim to protect his neck from the sun, which only accentuated his explorer look. He had left his trekking poles leaning against the trunk of the plane tree that shaded us, and Toni noticed that they were the most expensive ones among those sold at Decathlon. So he placed his next to them, which was of medium price, and asked me to do the same with mine, as it was the cheapest. "The complete range," he exclaimed as he took a picture of the set. Toni was touched by that, perhaps also because Julio told us that he was staying at the Los Agustinos hotel in Haro (a four-star hotel). The thing is that as we said goodbye and faced the first slopes, he said to me, "This guy owes me a glass of wine today."
I started pulling very hard, so much so that Toni fell behind. I got carried away, I felt euphoric and strong, I don't know if the beer I had just drunk had anything to do with it. I also remember the suffocating heat and the annoyance of the cloud of mosquitoes that formed in front of my face, around the shade provided by my hat or seeking my sweat. It was impossible to get rid of them, I waved my hand but they came back instantly and I felt like a cow relentlessly harassed. It was so annoying that maybe just because of that I climbed so fast.
From the mountain pass, there was a splendid view over the vineyards of Rioja Alta. The descent was also steep, with the path covered in stones. I was focused, looking at the ground to avoid tripping. Then Toni overtook me at full speed, as he used to run downhills like this. He said that by taking less time, he didn't strain his knees as much, something I didn't fully understand because, due to the speed, the pressure on them should be higher. But also, according to him, there was the risk, the challenge, the fun. This I understood better. By the time I reached the bottom, at the level of the first vines loaded with Tempranillo grapes, I was already walking alongside Toni at full speed.
Shortly after, Briñas' exit along the path next to the Ebro River suddenly felt familiar to me. But I had never been there before! Then a sequence from the movie The Way, starring Martin Sheen, came to mind, and it seemed to me that we were passing through the same place where it had been filmed. It was amazing that my senses had alerted me to it while I was listening to Toni, who wouldn't stop talking (complaining that in recent years the spirit of the Camino was being lost). I would have liked to stop and confirm with my phone that indeed those scenes from the movie had been filmed there. Also, I would have liked to gaze at the Ebro, but it was as if I too was being carried away by a current.
Given my inability to put a stop to the race, I noticed how irritation was surfacing in me. "The spirit of the Camino was being lost": ha!, what a cliché that was for an expert in the field like Toni supposedly was. And as he carried me along (or was it me who was carrying him?) by the banks of the Ebro, I remember thinking that he was not exactly a bearer of that "spirit" he spoke of, since constantly doing "Caminos" to Santiago seemed to me more like a sport or entertainment than a true pilgrimage, the kind of once-in-a-lifetime journey that I envisioned.
I arrived exhausted in Haro, walking dazed through its streets, with my senses dulled and feeling lazy, in danger of stumbling over a curb and falling flat. When we finally arrived in front of an old chalet that was the hostel, we called the indicated phone number for someone to come and open for us, and we threw ourselves on the ground to wait, without paying attention to whether the sidewalk was clean or not.
A volunteer from the local association appeared, a man of retirement age. He stamped our credentials and took our information before giving us the keys. Then, wanting to know something about us, he asked about our experience. When I told him it was "my first time," he replied:
—Well, it won't be the last, my friend. The Camino hooks you.
I was so exhausted that I lay down on the bunk without showering or anything and fell fast asleep. In the restless dream that followed, I kept hearing "the Camino hooks you, the Camino hooks you," while I ran to avoid being hooked by someone who in my nightmare was a confusing mix between Toni and the retiree from the association.
Despite everything, I recovered quite well during the afternoon and, after the nap, shaving, showering, putting cream on my feet, washing the clothes and hanging them out to dry, buying at a nearby supermarket and having an early dinner, Toni and I went to La Herradura, which is the name of the bar area in Haro. We walked around the circuit a few times (like a roulette wheel) and, in the end, we entered a bar with very high ceilings called Los Caños.
And there was Julio, sitting at a table with a snack and a glass of wine. Coincidence? The most striking thing was that neither Toni nor I remembered that we had talked about meeting again. But it was magnificent, with such freshness and naturalness, that it even tempted me to attribute it in a mystical way to the powers of the Camino.
We sat down with him and ordered a couple of red wines. Like the night before, the conversation began to revolve around the stories experienced by those two characters on the Camino de Santiago. Toni mentioned that two years earlier he had done it by bike, in tandem; he pedaled guiding a young blind man from Barcelona, through the Catalan Way first, then the Ebro Way, and finally the French Way, until reaching Santiago. As he explained the details of his experience with the blind boy, I realized that maybe I was wrong about him, and, at least in thought, I took my hat off.
I felt part of that pleasant conversation because I was allowed to intervene despite my lack of experience. It turns out that both had also traveled abroad (Toni to Latin America, Julio around the globe) and, as they spoke, I felt immersed in a parallel world, oblivious to the neighboring tables and the reality of the surroundings. It had been a long time since I had felt so good being part of a group of people.
—With all these travel experiences you have, have you ever thought about writing something? —I asked.
Actually, my question was directed to Julio, who, with the curiosity he showed for everything, seemed to me like someone who must be a writer.
"I have thought about it many times, but I wouldn't know how to do it," Toni replied.
I told him that simply by telling it, just as he was doing at that table, it would be good material, then he would find someone to help shape it. For example, that trip from Barcelona to Santiago that he had done on a tandem bike with the blind boy, he had talked about the problems they had encountered, the tensions that arose between them despite their camaraderie, the good and bad moments. What is it like to be a guide on the Camino? By being the eyes of another, did he perceive the places he already knew differently? How was the arrival in Santiago after such a long and intense journey? Your direct experience, I would love to read that story, I told him.
"You're right, I should do as you do," Toni told me after I finished my intervention, which I now realized may have been too eloquent. And then, addressing Julio, he said, "You have no idea how many pages he fills in his diary..."
"Hey," Julio said to me, "I'm sorry to ask, but what's your last name? I need it to identify you when you publish your book."
—Ha, ha, very good.
That broke the rules of the game. It crossed my mind to propose a deal: I would tell him my last name if he told me his in return. Because, let's see: who were they? Toni, a retired man in perfect physical shape, for his courage and discipline (except in matters of eating and drinking), in my imagination I had assigned him a military past, perhaps not very satisfactory because that would explain, considering his loquacity, why he still didn't know anything about his life. Julio, for how well he spoke and his exquisite manners, could be a judge or maybe a diplomat, as he was well-traveled and spoke languages. Could Julio be a public figure? This possibility intrigued me greatly. I paid close attention to the clues he gave because later, when I arrived at the hostel, the first thing I would do would be to look him up on the internet. But luck was not on my side, I never found out: without knowing his last name, it was difficult to find him in a Google image search. Perhaps he wasn't a famous person after all.
We left the bar telling each other that we would see each other again. But the truth is that when you walk the Camino de Santiago, you never know if you will see the person you just shared a good chat with again. We never saw Julio again, although at least Toni was relieved: he paid for the wines.

06. Haro - Santo Domingo de la Calzada (20.7 km)
We slept soundly at the Haro hostel, each in a room and the whole house to ourselves because the French did not show up. But the tranquility was going to end that same day, as soon as we arrived in Santo Domingo de la Calzada and joined the crowded French Way. Due to the uncertainty of what we were going to find, we set off very early to arrive as soon as possible, despite the stage being short and practically flat, a walk compared to the previous day.
Dawn caught us advancing along a path through vineyards, under a vast sky with scattered clouds illuminated by the first rays of the sun. In the distance, we saw some giant vehicles moving among the vines, giving the impression of being alien insects fallen from the sky that were devouring the harvest (upon reaching the grape harvesters, I wanted to check that, indeed, there was someone driving them inside). I soon spotted in the distance the tower of a bell tower and, influenced by how easy the stage was going to be, I naively believed that it must already be Santo Domingo. In reality, it was Zarratón, a halfway town where Toni and I stopped to have our first coffee of the day.
At the exit, I don't know why, I started throwing like a madman, with Toni close behind. In the middle of the field, as we passed by a farmhouse called Madrid de los Trillos, some dogs started barking at me. There were two of them and they were tied up, but suddenly a third one, black and not very big, appeared loose and came running towards me. Instinctively, I held out my stick in front of me as if wielding a sword. The animal stopped a couple of meters away, barking at me and showing me its teeth. I was very alert, but, extraordinarily for me, I didn't lose control of the situation and didn't let fear take over.
I knew Toni was coming behind me, he was probably watching me at that moment. Besides, the dog couldn't be dangerous if its owners let it roam freely in the middle of the Camino de Santiago (although you never know). And then there was the deciding factor, something that was becoming increasingly important to me and that I think was decisive for me to stay there still: the photo could be good, as well as the story, to share later on the blog. Getting it required not fleeing from the scene.
It all happened very quickly, these were all considerations I made almost unconsciously, with the dog barking at me and me taking out my phone with the hand that was free, the one not holding the cane. I took several pictures, I wanted to get one where the dog was looking at me fiercely and showing its teeth. But it kept moving and I couldn't get a really good one. And that's when I realized that the dog wasn't focused on me. In fact, it seemed to me that I was boring him and his reaction was more of a reflex than anything else. I put away the cane and immediately he stopped barking, and with him the other dogs. Then I resumed my walk.
When I had already advanced a few meters, the barking resumed behind me and I turned around to see how Toni was managing. Lacking a gun, he squeezed his water bottle with a spout so that a stream shot out ("shut up already, mutt"). According to him, that left them bewildered, although the dogs did not stop barking as he passed by.
Approaching Santo Domingo, we began to see from a certain distance the trail of walkers with backpacks who at that moment were arriving at the town following the French Way. "Wow!" I said to myself, stopping. That seemed impressive to me because after a week in which I had only seen six pilgrims, all of a sudden I was seeing something like ten times more.
"Tranquility is over," Toni said when he caught up with me, looking at them in turn.
I also understood it that way, that a part of the journey was ending that was not going to resemble at all what I expected from then on.
Watching all those people, suddenly, we were overcome by the fear of not finding a place at the hostel where we planned to stay. Even though we knew that the Brotherhood of the Holy One's shelter was one of the largest with over two hundred spots. Nevertheless, we got nervous and hurried to arrive as soon as possible.
In the entrance hall of the hostel, we came across a line of pilgrims queuing to check in. A man was instructing the newcomers, in Spanish and English, to leave their footwear and walking sticks in the room next to the entrance, as it was not allowed to bring them into the facilities. Grid shoe racks covered the walls of that room completely, with about a hundred pairs of boots and sneakers for when I left mine. Feeling a bit naked in flip-flops, I joined the line with Toni, behind two girls who claimed to be Australian, trusting that my belongings would be safe in that place.
We were assigned our bunk beds in a dormitory for twenty people, men and women, where it was difficult to move without tripping over a backpack. There were people from all over the world, but I couldn't help but notice Asians, perhaps because they caught my attention more. As I was laying out my sleeping bag, I noticed an older Mexican pilgrim, maybe around seventy years old. He was sitting on his bed with a distant look, looking tired. I had just heard him talking on the phone with what was probably his wife. "Yes, I've just arrived, yes, today's stage was shorter," I heard him say at a very high volume, as if to counteract the great distance between them. It seemed that the woman had been scared because he had called her before the usual time. "Yes, I'm fine, don't worry," the man reassured her over and over again. And then he said, "I love you very much," and repeated it again before saying goodbye to her with a trembling voice. He then remained lost in thought, sitting on the bed, doing nothing.
I felt down. Some Asians had laid down on the bunk beds to rest inside their sleeping bags, as if they were sick, and for a moment I had the feeling that we had been forcibly confined, that we were confined in some kind of concentration camp or refugee camp, far from our families. I missed my wife and wished to be back home with her. But the dejection didn't last long because I had to shave, shower, put cream on my feet, wash my clothes, and hang them to dry. And every day I had to pay attention when doing these basic tasks because the shelter was always a new one and I had to get used to its peculiarities. When I returned from the restroom, I noticed that the Mexican man had also started moving because the transport company had just brought him his backpack. So that was it: what I had attributed to a faint of melancholy from this man, perhaps it had only been a wait since he couldn't do much until his luggage arrived.
After going to buy dinner at a supermarket, we looked for a bar where we could calmly have a beer. Toni was very happy when he saw they had Estrella Damm bottles, his favorite, which he liked to drink straight from the bottle. I ordered a small beer. The waitress missed the mark a bit, and in terms of quantity, what she served me was about the same as Toni's fifth. However, the price was different: one twenty versus one eighty.
—The small bottle is a bit expensive, isn't it? —Toni protested to the girl.
—"How expensive? It's the price here," she replied, hurt. Her accent seemed Romanian.
By "here" I understood that he was referring to the town, where it was common to charge for those consumptions. Those prices seemed normal to me, but Toni didn't back down and, sternly, reproached the Romanian woman for taking advantage of pilgrims like us who were just passing through. The young woman was not one to stay silent, but that didn't stop her face from reflecting the discomfort of the unfair treatment she was receiving from a customer. I felt really sorry for her, she surely had enough on her plate trying to get by without being treated like that.
When we went out to the terrace with our drinks, I was about to tell Toni that he had been wrong. But I didn't dare. And I can't remember for the life of me how he started talking to me about his life; I certainly didn't ask him. It was enough for me to attribute to him a dark military past and for us to continue sharing beers, especially now that we were surrounded by a multitude of pilgrims to gossip about. But the fact is that he briefly told me who he was: divorced, father of a son; for much of his professional life, he had been a salesperson of electrical material until he got tired of it and set up a distribution business of the same material on his own, which failed, and then another one with a partner that also went bankrupt due to the crisis. After that, he had decided to dedicate himself to traveling, living off sporadic jobs (he didn't say what kind) and with the small subsidy he received as an unemployed person over fifty-five. I remembered that when I met him in Zegama, he introduced himself as "early retired," without going into further detail, and now I understood that this allowed him to adopt an identity that fell within the norm, given his age.
I felt compelled to reciprocate by telling him something about myself. If we had endured together this far, it was a sign that there could be some trust between us. Besides, it seemed clear that we were going to keep seeing each other at least until León. (In León, Toni planned to deviate from the French Way by following a different route to Santiago). So I mentioned to him that I had a wife (he already knew that). That throughout my life I had worked basically as a programmer of industrial automatons, but that I had always struggled in the professional world and, in order to grow and try to gain some confidence in myself, I had made a hopeful and desperate professional leap as a solutions salesperson and project leader. And that this leap, reaching forty, turned out to be fatal because after that, nothing. But the consequences had not been entirely bad, since the last few years, during which I had been unemployed, had allowed me to understand that throughout my life I had followed, like an automaton, a stressed way of living that responded to a program written by God knows who.
It's done, it was already said.
—Well, at least now you'll be more relaxed, right? —he asked me.
"No way, I'm the same," I replied. "But it's curious, I wouldn't go back to how things were before even if I were crazy. So I guess, yes, I'm better."
They passed by the terrace where the two Australian women who had preceded us at the hostel entrance were sitting, followed by two other pilgrims wearing tight leggings, who, according to Toni, were also staying there. I didn't miss a thing either, let's not deny it. The street was full of pilgrims and we started talking about the people. It was more pleasant that way. Later on, I realized that I was in front of someone who spent a good part of the year away from home, walking "Caminos". Toni, as a pre-retiree, must not have felt very calm either.
That night I had a pre-cooked potato omelette, accompanied by white rice and a salad. It was hard for us to heat the food because the kitchen of the hostel was taken over by Koreans (almost all Asians were Koreans) and we had to wait for them to free up the microwave. The truth is that the dining room and common area of the hostel were very lively. There were groups of pilgrims joyfully emptying bottles of Rioja. And also many people alone, who did not stand out at all, looking at their phones, reading, or even writing in their journals. I remembered the book "The Immortal Way", in it, the author says that he did not take any notes during the journey because he trusted his memory, which acted as a filter for what was truly relevant to him when he started writing about the experience later. And he added that he even "got irritated seeing some pilgrims, during the stages, wasting precious moments of contemplation to scribble in notebooks." Maybe he was right, but I needed to write, so after dinner I went to look for my notebook and started "scribbling" at a long table, accompanied by others who were also doing the same. It was not only a matter of jotting down the details of what had happened to me during the day, I also needed to finish the conversation I had had with Toni about our lives, which had been interrupted. Yes, it was true, now I felt just as stressed as before. But I was better, because that was precisely what I had learned, that I was still the same. That ups and downs were essentially inevitable and my power over them limited. There was no room for hopeful illusions and life had become, perhaps, harsher. Also more authentic. I lacked the protection of a normal life, but in return, I had myself. I wanted to continue. From the next day, all the way to Santiago, it was all westward.



I came across this dog barking and I stopped him in his tracks with my cane. I took photos of him while he stood there. I didn't manage to capture an image where the dog was looking at me while showing his teeth. However, in the meantime, I confirmed that his bark was more for show than anything else.



The shoemaker at the hostel is spectacular. I count the pairs to know how many of us there are. The color of the shoes is lost because the dust of the road makes them all the same. I was hesitant to leave my sneakers there, what if they steal them? I had to enter the hostel barefoot and that made me feel naked, as if they had confiscated the weapon with which I protect myself.

07. Santo Domingo de la Calzada - Belorado (22 km)
I spent a restless night in the common room. I had trouble falling asleep because among so many people, I kept hearing noises of shifting positions, heavy breathing, and snoring. Additionally, my bunk bed was next to the door, and since the hinges squeaked, I would wake up every time someone left to go to the bathroom. At five o'clock, I woke up to the hustle and bustle of the Koreans, the first ones to leave. I also heard the crowing of a rooster and remembered that the Cathedral of Santo Domingo, with its rooster and hen inside, was very close to the hostel. By the time the bells struck six, I had been lying in bed for a while, and at that hour, it seemed to me that most people were up and about, so I got up too.
I said goodbye to Toni, who was having breakfast in the dining room. Today, I really intended to distance myself from him and go my own way, which would be easier to achieve because we were on the Camino Francés and the accommodation options were varied. I had mentioned to him that in Belorado I planned to stay at a hostel that had caught my eye from home, one with very good reviews on the internet.
"I told him they have a garden with a heated pool. And they offer a yoga session for pilgrims," I added, mentioning that I used to practice yoga.
He seemed to understand it. He would sleep in a public shelter, as always.
—Well, then we'll see each other in Belorado.
When I went out, I was impressed by the amount of people walking on the street despite it still being pitch dark. I went into a café just a few steps away from the hostel. The only waiter there was taking a long time to serve breakfast because, apparently, the coffee machine wasn't working properly. He was getting nervous as the customers kept piling up, constantly entering the establishment. I was also getting anxious while waiting for him to attend to me, and through the window facing the street, I could see the flow of pilgrims continuing on their way. In the end, I got overwhelmed and left the place without ordering anything.
I started following the groups ahead of me, without paying attention to the yellow arrows or remembering them. With the poor lighting of the street lamps, the signage didn't stand out, and it didn't occur to me to take out the flashlight from my backpack. In any case, so many people (about twenty) couldn't be wrong, so I followed along, confident. And when we reached the end of the urban area and ventured into the darkness as a herd, suddenly, a local heading to work in the fields shouted at us from the other side of a fork in the road:
—Hey!! But where are you going? The path is this way!
Some giggles were heard as we all quickly turned around, feeling uncomfortable as our gregarious behavior was exposed. Apparently, I wasn't the only one blindly following the others.
Shortly after, I noticed a discomfort in my left foot and instinctively slowed down. But I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, I thought it would pass. Or rather, I didn't want it to bother me at that moment, when it was getting light and I began to pay closer attention to the pilgrims in front of me and those coming from behind. I had the feeling that I was part of something like an exodus. I was walking slower than average and I was being overtaken every so often with people saying "¡buen Camino!" with a foreign accent. I wondered where they were from. I also started greeting everyone in this way, taking the initiative when I caught up with someone who was going slower. And that's how I began to feel part of that community.
The landscape opened up to vast fields of sunflowers, and after Grañón (where I had breakfast, taking my time to relax my sore foot), to vast fields of already harvested cereal. As the morning progressed, I entered the province of Burgos and realized that the crowd had dispersed. And, although pilgrims were still visible, I was relieved to find that in Castile the space widened and it was possible to walk peacefully as if I were alone.
In Belorado, looking for my accommodation, I passed by the parish hostel and there I found Toni, sitting outside at one of the tables with chairs set up like a terrace, all showered and combed, preparing a ham sandwich. He hadn't been able to arrive first because "you can never catch up with these early morning psychopaths," he said referring to an Asian man who was sitting a few meters away and had slept in our room in Santo Domingo. Apparently, the parish hostel was nice, without luxuries but clean, and there weren't many people yet. Indeed, it seemed peaceful and, for a moment, I thought about staying there with him, but I said goodbye until later and continued on to Cuatro Cantones, which was the name of my hostel.
At the reception, I came across a small group of pilgrims who had just arrived before me. They had reserved a spot, and they had done well because there were only two free bunk beds left, the manager told them in perfect English, a young woman with a permanent smile that reminded me of the excellent reviews that this private establishment received. While she was registering them on her laptop, she asked if they wanted to sign up for the communal dinner for pilgrims, where a great atmosphere usually formed, as they organized some group activity for people to participate in.
I went out into the street. I was still in time to go back to Toni's place. I slung the backpack that I had left outside next to the door over my shoulder and hurried towards the parish hostel. But after walking about fifty meters, I stopped, hesitating. What was I doing? Why was I running away? And above all, how would I explain it? I turned around and went back to Cuatro Cantones. The previous group had already entered and the lobby was clear. I stayed with one of the two remaining available spots, and when the attendant asked me if I wanted to sign up for the community dinner, I said no, I didn't want to. No one was forcing me to, I don't know what had gotten into me.
What I did after settling in, shaving, showering, putting cream on my feet, washing and hanging the clothes, was to go down to eat the daily menu at the hostel itself. Apparently, in private hostels, the business was sustained thanks to the kitchen, and perhaps because it was Saturday, their restaurant was full of families from Belorado or the surrounding area and non-pilgrim people. Beans, hake, bread, wine, and flan. I had not eaten with a tablecloth and proper dishes for a week. I had to wait quite a while to be served, but I didn't mind because next to my table there was an outlet where I charged my phone and rested while reading the news.
The hostel was decorated with style and the atmosphere was pleasant. Except in the rooms, everywhere (including the bathrooms) there was background music playing with the best international hits from recent years. They were somewhat melancholic songs that made me feel nostalgic as I tried to write something in the common area. I went out to the garden and sat in a chair in the shade of some olive trees, occasionally watching someone swim in the heated pool. It was a shame that I didn't feel like taking a swim. I remembered the yoga session they supposedly offered and approached the reception to inquire. No, there wasn't anymore, the always smiling girl told me, as the website stated that service was only offered during the summer (forgetting to specify that their summer was limited to July and August).
At dusk, I went out for a walk through the streets of Belorado, a town with shops, most of them closed at that time on Saturday. I would have liked to do some sightseeing with a bit of formality, as I had imagined I would do in the visited towns, but the truth is that I didn't feel like it much and my foot was feeling sore. I missed my wife, I would call her later to talk to her. In the meantime, I walked a bit downcast along the so-called "Paseo del Ánimo" (Walk of Encouragement), to see if it had any effect. It was a kind of Hollywood Walk of Fame that had been set up along the urban route of the Camino de Santiago. Some famous personalities had already left their foot and handprints there, for example, the actor Martin Sheen as the protagonist of The Way, whose plaque I took a photo of.
I sat on a bench in the Plaza Mayor, in front of the music kiosk, with nothing to do. I saw many pilgrims wandering around and also locals strolling and going to bars. Then Toni appeared, who was also taking a walk. I was very happy to see him. We went to have a beer and then stopped by a supermarket to buy something for the next day. We said goodbye early because I had to return to the parish hostel, as he had a community dinner to attend, "by donation". Due to our different plans for the next two stages, as we probably wouldn't see each other again until Burgos, before parting ways we exchanged phone numbers, this time at my suggestion.
           08. Belorado — San Juan de Ortega (23.9 km)
At the same Four Cantones hostel, I had a buffet-style breakfast, like in a hotel. I helped myself to juice, toast, fried eggs with bacon, and coffee with milk. The dining room was small, and the manager would show you where to sit to fill in the empty spaces at the tables. Shortly after taking my seat, a blonde girl with a foreign appearance sat down across from me.
—Good morning —I greeted.
"Good morning," he replied, raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes wide, which I interpreted as follows: "Good morning, but I don't speak Spanish, so if you want to communicate with me, you'll have to do it in English."
Her name was Agnes and she was Danish. We commented on the large number of people who were doing the Camino de Santiago in September; she had also assumed that it would be quieter than in the middle of summer.
—In fact, tonight I took the last available spot at the hostel —he told me.
- Did you sleep in the Koreans' room?
—Yes, and they are very kind after all. When I went to bed, they asked for permission to turn on the lights early in the morning, at five, which is when they get up. How do you know that I shared the room with them?
I explained to her that if she took the last bed, the one before it was for me. Between the two beds offered by the manager, instead of sleeping with the group of Koreans, I preferred to do it in another smaller room. Later, I regretted my choice. It turned out to be a small attic room where eight people fit and not one more. It had only a small window, insufficient to ventilate a loft room where it was very hot. I spent the night sweating, with my back wet on my polyester sleeping bag. There were no Koreans there, but still someone got up at five in the morning, with the consequent noise of bags while preparing the backpack. And then others did the same. At six, I got up and felt a great relief to leave the suffocation of that tiny room where no one was left. It occurred to me that perhaps people woke up so early because they wanted to escape as soon as possible from the crowded dormitories and breathe fresh air.
"Are you not making a reservation?" I asked Agnes.
—I don't like it, I haven't come to do the Camino to be making reservations for fear of not finding a place.
I told him that I thought the same.
And that, when said, sounded very good. But as I stepped out onto the street, while tightening the straps of my backpack to set off, I heard a group of Spanish pilgrims with their mobile phones in hand saying that they had called the hostels in Agés (the reference town on that stage) and they were told they were full ("the town is taken over by Koreans," they added), and that since you couldn't make a reservation at the San Juan de Ortega monastery and it usually filled up quickly, it was best to hurry up.
So I started to feel overwhelmed again, especially because from the first steps I realized that my left foot still hurt. It was a pain that encompassed the entire foot but that I especially felt in the ankle and the instep. I think, for the first time, I became aware that things could really go wrong if I didn't walk carefully. And I also started to look resentfully at those pilgrims who used luggage transport services and passed me by quickly, with a small backpack on their back in which they seemed to carry an apple and water.
I was going very slowly. On the contrary, my head sped up. If I didn't run, it was most likely that by the time I reached San Juan de Ortega, I would find it full. Then I would have to keep walking to Agés, but there wouldn't be a place there either (damn Koreans), and then I would have to continue to Atapuerca, but it would be too many kilometers for my injured foot, which that day was not in a condition to walk so much. Besides, who could assure me that there wouldn't be an accommodation problem in Atapuerca? I should start booking, I told myself; but no, no way, damn it, I hadn't come to the Camino to be booking, but to be calm, to meet myself, my fears, to think about what I was going to do with my life.
This is how I covered the first kilometers, until an idea occurred to me. I checked the weather forecast and the expected temperatures for that area on my phone. It was going to be a very good night: clear sky, sixteen degrees, no wind: perfect for sleeping under the stars. There, I thought, I've got it. And suddenly, I felt excited about the idea of bivouacking for the first time in my life. The issue of humidity was there, because I hadn't brought the mat-just-in-case, but I had enough warm clothing. What worried me more was the fear that would come over me as soon as I heard a noise of branches in the darkness. But I would survive and then I could write about the experience, share it on the blog, and it would look great, very adventurous. I don't think I would have dared to do it on my own initiative, and I felt grateful that circumstances were forcing me to. I was determined: in case there was no room at the San Juan de Ortega hostel, I would look for a peaceful place nearby, maybe in a clearing in the forest.
In fact, now I preferred to stay outside and slowed down even more to definitely arrive late. In Villafranca Montes de Oca, I sat under an umbrella on the terrace of a bar and had a café con leche while killing time. Then I started the ascent towards Alto de la Pedraja through oak and holm oak forests. My foot was still hurting, but I was very careful, leaning on the cane with my left hand to unload some weight from that side (the cane acting as a crutch). I passed by the monument to those shot in 1936, but, as in so many other special places on the Camino, I didn't give it a second thought, so absorbed was I in my own thoughts and in my foot.
In the middle of a pine forest, I arrived at an outdoor stand where they offered coffee, soft drinks, cookies, and fruit in exchange for a donation. It was called The Oasis of the Way. There were hammocks stretched between the trees, and seats and small tables made from tree trunks. Summer party music was playing. "What a great vibe!" I thought to myself as I asked the lively person in charge to serve me a lemonade and, grateful, left a euro in exchange. Then she asked me if I had accommodation for that night, as she could make a reservation for me at a hostel in Agés. So that was it. I told her no, and that besides, I didn't need it, and I drank the lemonade in one gulp and continued on my way.
The majestic appearance of the San Juan de Ortega monastery took me by surprise, perhaps because after the twelve kilometers through forests, I had forgotten that it would eventually appear. I headed to the door of the hostel, scanning for a sign with the "Completo/Full" notice. But I didn't find it, and oddly enough, as soon as I crossed the threshold, I hoped there would be room, because all I wanted at that moment was to shower and rest on a soft bed. And when I entered reception and asked, it turned out there was availability: "No problem," said the hospitalero, who seemed surprised that it was so quiet that year "when last year, around the same dates and time, the hostel used to be full." Well, go figure, I thought, confused yet relieved. I settled in, shaved, showered, put cream on my feet, washed my clothes, and hung them on the clotheslines in the small cloister of the monastery. Then I took a light nap on the bunk bed. And later, just before dinner time, I went to the bar for a cold beer and drank it outside, thinking that, in any case, camping would have been crazy, because what I needed was a good rest.
Furthermore, by staying there, that night I would have the opportunity to try the typical garlic soups of the place. They had become a tradition since the nineties when Father Alonso started serving them, the parish priest who was considered a great benefactor of the Camino for the help he provided to pilgrims when the current infrastructure did not yet exist. I couldn't miss the garlic soups, as they appeared in another book that I had read to prepare for the trip, titled "I Will Never Reach Santiago". In it, the author, Gregorio Morán, describes a very funny scene when he had them in the presence of this priest, whom he portrays in a devastating way that does not correspond to the image that has remained of him.
And they weren't bad, at least in terms of flavor. In fact, I would say that the garlic soup was the most acceptable part of the dinner. Nowadays, in San Juan de Ortega, there were no longer clergymen, only laypeople, and instead of dining as a family, you had to queue with your tray to be served in a spacious dining hall. The problems started there, when I went to pick up the cutlery and the glass, because I noticed they were greasy and had traces of dirt, and it took me quite a while to choose mine. The garlic soup had to be specifically requested, otherwise they wouldn't bring it to you (would they save it for the next day?). Then there were spiral pasta with an industrial tomato sauce poured straight from the jar. And for the main course, with some lettuce leaves, pork loin steaks that were as tough as a shoe sole ("One or two?" they would ask. "Two, of course, two." Although I couldn't finish the second one). For dessert, an impossible-to-peel orange. Bread and water. Ten euros.
When I went to bed, I thought that in a place like that they could always offer the same menu because the clientele was renewed daily. Out of curiosity, I looked up the opinions on the internet of pilgrims who had passed through there (before the trip, I had skipped those of this place, as I intended to stay here anyway, to try the soups). And that's when I understood. That explained why there was no problem with beds in the hostel. The hospitalero, who was surprised by the low turnout that year, undoubtedly had not read them.
09. San Juan de Ortega - Burgos (25.8 km)
I slept like a blessed one at the San Juan de Ortega monastery, due to tiredness and because the dormitory was spacious: I definitely preferred to sleep with many people but in a large room with high ceilings, rather than with fewer people in a cubicle.
Around six o'clock, some early risers were already making noise, even though there were no Asians (they usually didn't stay in hostels where they couldn't use the kitchen, as was the case). I felt awake, so I got up too. By six-thirty, I was at the hostel's door. People were leaving, but I, for the time being, and especially after the rough departure from Santo Domingo, preferred to wait for the first light of day. I got myself a latte from the vending machine at reception and drank it outside, sitting on a bench. Everything was calm, indeed it had been an ideal night to sleep outdoors. I looked at the starry sky, towards the Milky Way, and the word "Compostela" came to mind.
Noticing that the pilgrims were leaving finally hastened my departure. I checked on Google Maps where the next village, Agés, was located, and seeing that it was straight ahead on a track, I told myself that there shouldn't be any problem. I tied the headlamp to my head and, as if I were on a special mission, I started walking, leaving behind the lights of the monastery and entering the darkness. Soon I reached a crossroads where, although it seemed obvious which way to go, pointing the beam of light in different directions, I looked for the yellow arrow that would confirm it for me. But there was some ambiguity in the signage, so I started to doubt, I couldn't afford to make a mistake in the dark and in the mountains. I took out my phone to orient myself again on the map and, in the midst of it all, someone caught up with me coming from behind, using the two sticks that resonated alternately. It was the old man who had slept in the bunk below.
I had seen him for the first time on the previous day's stage, as I overtook him at some point (even though I was going very slowly): a man who must have been in his seventies, tall and thin, with long gray beards and disheveled hair, with suffering reflected on his face and walking with great difficulty. Deep into the afternoon, when he appeared like a wreck in the hostel bedroom, I felt admiration for him and shame for my personal concerns during the stage. In his pitiful physical condition and being a foreigner, he seemed to trust in finding a place to sleep wherever he arrived and at whatever time he did. I had just woken up from my light nap and watched him crawl around the room looking for a bunk. There were no free lower bunks left, so he settled for the one above where I was.
Like most people, I also preferred the bottom bunk. I liked having my backpack accessible from the bed. It was also easier and less noisy to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Besides, using the ladder with bare and sore feet was not pleasant. For all these reasons, I was glad when I occupied one of the bottom bunks in San Juan de Ortega. And yet, I had already anticipated what had ended up happening, similar to when I get on a city bus and I am happy to find an empty seat, but at the same time I am not relaxed because I might have to give it up to someone more in need who gets on at the next stop.
"Thank you," the old man said to me in a hoarse voice that was both deep.
He didn't smile at me, nor did I see any sign of relief in him, nothing. He simply accepted what was offered to him, that was all. I quickly moved my things to the top bunk, while he settled in below with his slow movements.
Despite being bunk bed neighbors, we didn't interact much. Except for one time, minutes before the bedroom lights went out at night. He saw me struggling with a plug to charge my phone, it was from a power strip with stiff prongs making it difficult to fit in. As I fought with it, the old man came towards me, but by the time he reached me, I had already managed to plug it in.
"Did you plug it in?" he asked me.
—Yes.
"Good," he said, and turning around, he went to bed.
I was glad to have given him my bunk bed.
And in the morning, at that crossroads at the exit of San Juan de Ortega, the old man didn't hesitate about which way to go. So I moved forward and left him behind again. Along the track that cut straight through the pine forest, lighting my way with the headlamp, sometimes I turned around and saw at a certain distance the beam of his light and those of other pilgrims coming from afar behind. That reassured me and allowed me to enjoy my first solo night walk in the mountains under the stars. Three kilometers later, due to the mist covering the valley, the lights of the street lamps in the urban center of Agés appeared wrapped in halos. It was starting to get light.
I had breakfast in the next town, in Atapuerca, and then I climbed the hill of the same name, from whose summit you could see in the distance, surrounded by yellow fields, the city of Burgos. The situation was very similar to the one I had experienced when arriving in Vitoria a week before: the end of the stage within sight (but still more than fifteen kilometers to go!), heat and eagerness to arrive, an eagerness heightened by the sight of pilgrims who were moving more swiftly and would reach the hostel before me.
How did I let myself get dragged once again? At that moment, my foot still hadn't started bothering me and it would have been a good opportunity to walk slowly and be conscious of each step I took. I would have tried to figure out what was going wrong, make small changes that could give me some clue as to why my foot was hurting. And at the same time, maybe I would have used that attentive disposition to relax and enjoy the places I was passing through and to observe that absurd fear of being left out or not measuring up to others. Perhaps I could have done the exercise of trusting in what had to be, just as the old pilgrim I had met in San Juan de Ortega used to do.
But no, there was no way, that was stronger than me, so I made the same mistakes as always, I got overwhelmed and started running in one of my fits and left myself behind somewhere along the way. It happened near Burgos airport; there, you could take an alternative route a bit longer to enter the city through a grove by the river, instead of taking the official, shorter route that crossed industrial estates. I wish I could say that my choice was reasoned, that I took the longer path to enjoy the shade of the poplars despite the fact that, due to the state of my already sore foot, the shorter one was more convenient for me. But the truth is that all I did was follow those ahead of me. And the problem was that this alternative route was not well signposted, many yellow arrows of "confirmation" were missing, the ones that simply assure you that you are on the right track. And since those ahead were going so fast that they were slipping away from me, I did my best not to lose sight of them by forcing my pace.
Finally, I lost them, but I was already in residential areas near the city and it was easy to find someone to ask. My foot hurt, but I had switched to autopilot, so I kept going full speed along the riverbank trails that after a few kilometers led to a park in Burgos. Even though there was no way to get lost, I kept scanning for the yellow arrows, not wanting to go even a hundred meters extra due to a mistake. And then I noticed that these arrows were sometimes painted on the park's lampposts, lampposts whose design made them look like question marks. "What a great photo for the blog!" I said to myself, stopping instantly to take it and thinking about the text that would accompany it, in which I would relate the symbol of doubt to the arrow as the answer.
At the end of the park, I crossed the river over a bridge and found myself walking along the sidewalks of the expansion of Burgos. Like in Vitoria, I felt strange being dirty and looking like a vagabond among the citizens, as if I were a barbarian. I instinctively looked for my tribe, for the pilgrims that I occasionally distinguished among the crowds in the city center. And as I passed by their side, I almost shouted "¡buen Camino!" so that, despite the hustle and bustle of the street and the noise of traffic, they could hear me well and see me as one of their own; and some turned around surprised because, now that I think about it, in an urban and normalized setting like that, maybe it was no longer appropriate to greet each other, especially not with such enthusiasm.
The municipal hostel in Burgos, located a few meters from the cathedral, was huge and there was no problem with availability. There I met Toni again, whom I hadn't seen since Belorado. In the evening, it was a pleasure to have dinner again in his company in the hostel's dining room. With the pre-cooked "heat and eat" meals we had bought in a supermarket in the afternoon, we had some cans of beer from a vending machine. At one point, he showed me his right forearm: on the inside, a row of insect bites went up from his wrist to his elbow.
—And that?
—Bedbugs. They also make their way, just like us.
In the hostels, they were fearsome, lodging in the crevices of the bunk beds and mattresses, waiting for night to come to attack their victims. We brought them in on our clothes as pilgrims when we entered the dormitory after walking through the countryside, that's why they made us leave our boots outside, although we could also carry them in our backpacks or clothes.
Toni had been stung at the Belorado parish. And I remembered that there, he had had an English pilgrim as a bunk neighbor (he pointed him out to me when we saw him pass by the street, it was Mahmud, whom I will talk about later), who as soon as he arrived at the hostel had laid down on the bed just like that, without showering or anything, as if he had just come back from a walk in the countryside. I mentioned to him that, coincidentally, that man was my downstairs neighbor that night.
—Oh, well, be careful.
I used to like to go to bed early to update the blog before they turned off the lights (at ten) and I was left in the dark, straining my eyes with the light from my phone. But often I was caught off guard and had no choice but to do it that way. It didn't matter if I was tired, it was important for me to post the photos with their brief notes without missing a single day, this way I felt close to my family. And even though I had set up the blog so that it didn't allow comments from readers, I didn't want to worry about responding and thanking each compliment promptly, or on the contrary, hurt by their absence, these things always took a lot of energy from me. However, I knew that besides my wife, my father, in-laws, brothers, and brothers-in-law read me, because from time to time I received messages from them letting me know and encouraging me. The truth was that in these daily chronicles I was exposing myself, perhaps because the distance allowed me to open up, something I had never dared to do before, even less since I was not working and felt lost. And with their support, feeling their esteem, I felt exultant and very motivated to continue with the task of telling my journey.
That's why it bothered me to get upset like that morning running towards Burgos, because I was sure that in that way I was missing things that I could later bring to my blog. And yet, it seemed amazing to me that in the midst of those clouds, clearings opened up through which ideas appeared. That same night, as I tried to fall asleep thinking about the bedbugs of which I didn't know if the man sleeping in the bunk below would be a carrier or not, I received a couple of messages about my posts on the streetlight shaped like a question mark and the sense of belonging to the Camino tribe that I had experienced upon arriving in the city. I fell asleep feeling embraced and no longer worried about the bedbugs.
At intersections, the yellow arrows indicate which way to go. But there are also ones like the one in the photo, which simply confirm that you are on the right track. Since I am obsessed with not making mistakes, I constantly look for them. And when I cover a certain distance without seeing them, an unsettling question mark arises in my head. But suddenly, an upward arrow appears that is like a hand with a raised thumb. And I feel reassured.
           10. Burgos — Hornillos del Camino (21 km)
Around six-thirty in the morning, I walked out the door of the Burgos hostel and headed straight to the bar across the street, an establishment whose clientele was mainly pilgrims and had the same schedule as them. Upon entering, I had the feeling that there must have been quite a few people having breakfast somewhere in the premises, although at that moment there were only two or three of us at the bar. I quickly understood the reason for that impression: there were a good number of backpacks tucked away in the corners. And not just backpacks, there were also suitcases (the Camino de Santiago with Samsonite suitcases!). With my café con leche in hand, I approached to read what was written on the tags hanging from them. During the morning, the transport service from a company called Jacotrans would come to pick them up to take them to a (private) hostel in Hontanas, thirty kilometers from Burgos, where their owners had reserved a spot and where they would be heading with light luggage.
I wasn't going to go that far that day, the stages proposed by the guide I was following were closer to twenty kilometers than thirty. Besides, I wasn't in a condition to walk that much, because the problem with my foot not only persisted but seemed to be getting worse: just as in previous days, the discomfort had appeared after the first kilometers, this time it started hurting me as soon as I took the first steps out of the bar. The idea of using the transportation service crossed my mind, it wasn't expensive and I was sure that without the load my foot would recover quickly. But I dismissed it immediately because it seemed sacrilegious to me, I preferred to stop and rest at a hostel for a day or two and then see how it goes.
Carrying my things was important to me. It allowed me to be aware of the effort it took to carry them and to value them (take care of them) to the extent that I needed them. This way, I could see more clearly the burden that the "just in case" items represented. Before leaving home, I had already gone through the exercise of including only the essentials. Could I really not do without anything else? I began to consider getting rid of a raincoat that would provide some warmth in case it got cold during the trip. It was the only thing I had to wear over the only tracksuit jacket I had. Since I had weighed it before leaving home, I knew that by getting rid of it, I would be shedding about 600 grams.
Since my foot had started hurting, I was obsessed with what I put in my backpack. Weight was a decisive factor when selecting the food I bought for the next day's stage (to the point that at the fruit shop's scale, I would consider taking one banana or another, depending on its weight). The previous afternoon, I had gone to a pharmacy in Burgos to get ibuprofen for the inflammation in my foot. I asked for the smallest container they had, and when the pharmacist handed me the box with the pills, the first thing I did was look for the weight in the product description. When I read "600," I got scared because in my confusion, for a moment, I related it to the 600 grams of the raincoat, before realizing and seeing that this figure referred to the composition of the medication in milligrams.
Some people were taking Voltaren for inflammation and muscle pain. An Irish woman my age named Fran, when she asked me how I was and I replied that my foot hurt, told me that she had been taking it for a couple of days.
—And now nothing hurts me anymore —she said delighted.
I was resting on a bench in the shade in Rabé de las Calzadas, and she sat down next to me to drink water from the bottle she had just filled at the fountain. We had seen each other the day before, in my bewildered race along the alternative road to Burgos; she was one of the ones from the group I had barely managed to follow.
Fran told me that he was happy because since he started taking Voltaren, he felt great, so he would be able to cross the plateau quickly, reaching León in six days.
"I am doing the Camino in stages," he told me. "In just over a week, I have to go back to work, and my plan is to pick it up again on my next vacation, maybe in the spring, to finish it."
That's why she extended the stage to Hontanas, the same place where the backpacks she had seen early in the morning at the bar were heading. In my case, reaching León would take me two more days, eight in total. I thought that I would also like to take less time, especially because the stretch between Burgos and León was supposed to be the toughest, with the sun and heat forecasted for the next few days and the monotony of the desolate landscapes. Besides, I was feeling somewhat discouraged. I remembered what I had read about what happens in the second week of the journey, when the initial enthusiasm and adrenaline rush give way to the accumulated fatigue from daily walks, discomforts, and poor sleep in the hostels. Not to mention the pains. Because of this, what supposedly awaited me in the next few days had a touch of a "desert crossing."
Those landscapes also had a touch of western. From the hill that led to Hornillos del Camino, there was a sensational view. Under the midday sun, the winding road down to the village was white. Hornillos appeared in the distance among dry fields and a few trees, and in the background there were hills with slopes of eroded white rock. The only thing missing was the horses.
Gregorio Morán says in "I Will Never Reach Santiago" that when they arrived at this town in the early nineties, it was like stepping into a Western movie, consisting only of a long and deserted street. When I did it, Hornillos was still a street, but it was invaded by a crowd of pilgrims who were occupying the different hostels along it.
I headed straight to the municipal, where I would find Toni. I had decided that I would no longer complicate things with accommodation: I would always go to public ones (where you couldn't reserve), whichever was available in each place. This way, I would avoid the hassle of looking at reviews, hesitating about where to go each time, whether I should book or not, it would be too much time wasted pondering these things. Besides, after my experience in Belorado's (very cute indeed), it seemed to me that I wouldn't know how to take advantage of its amenities and they wouldn't guarantee me a good rest, which was all I needed.
At the reception, I was assisted by a young man, probably Senegalese, because he was wearing the national football team's jersey. He stamped my badge, took my information, and asked me if I wanted to sign up for the breakfast the next day, at a cost of three euros.
"I don't know, well, I'm not sure," I said hesitantly.
The truth is, I would have preferred to go to a bar to have my coffee with milk accompanied by whatever, it was one of my little pleasures. But I felt bad about being inconsiderate by telling him directly no, that boy surely needed the income he got from this type of services. I could have told him to give me some time to think about it, but instead he kept staring at me, waiting for me to make a decision. He was making me feel uncomfortable.
"It's for you," he told me. "Keep in mind that in the morning you won't have anything until the next town, Hontanas, ten kilometers from here."
I would have liked to find out for myself, ask later in the village bars what time they opened. But he kept staring at me and I noticed the unease that was already rising in me, so I told him yes, okay, I didn't want to make a big deal out of it either (and yes, on the other hand, to let me go).
In the bedroom, I found Toni, freshly showered and groomed.
"I've got pole," he laughed to himself. "Pole position: I've finally arrived first at the hostel," he said, pointing to the identifier on his bunk, the one for bed number one.
He waited for me to get settled, and after shaving, showering, putting cream on my feet, washing and hanging the clothes, the two of us went to the bar next door, Casa Manolo. We had a bottle of beer outside, on a bench, next to some locals with straw hats sitting in the shade, and we started watching, as if it were a cycling race, the lagging pilgrims. Suddenly, we heard someone coming up the street singing a serenade. They were two Italians who instead of carrying backpacks, were pushing (or pulling) some carts that looked like a joke. One of them, with long gray beards, shouted "Andiamo a Santiago!!", and alternated singing it with a tenor voice the "'O sole mio". And they meant it. When I went to take a picture of them, they posed smiling for me and then continued towards Hontanas, under the blazing sun.
The municipal hostel in Hornillos was very small, a stone house with a cubic shape, with only one floor and a basement, almost attached to the church. In fact, in the afternoon, seeking some peace and coolness, I went with my notebook to write in the church, as if it were just another room of the hostel. After that, once I had finished "my homework", I was free to socialize.
Being next to Toni made it easier to interact with the other pilgrims. That night, for dinner, we shared some white beans and a chicken that was already roasted in its container. In the narrow dining room with a kitchen at the hostel, we sat at the common table where half a dozen Asians were having dinner, all women except for one man. At first, I thought they were all Korean, but some were speaking to others in English.
"Did you really mistake me for a Korean?" Emika, who was Japanese, asked me when I told her.
We started chatting because Toni already knew her, at some point during the day they had crossed paths. He was delighted with her because she was a young and smiling girl and spoke perfect Spanish as she had studied philology in Salamanca. Emika was traveling with another Japanese friend. At the table there was also a Taiwanese girl and the rest were indeed Koreans.
On the other corner sat the only man in the group accompanied by his wife, both having dinner with their half-liter beer cans. When they finished, the man, always cheerful, mixed the leftover white rice with some seaweed brought from Korea and made a ball out of it, wrapping it all in kitchen cling film afterwards.
—This is a very good breakfast! —he told us, raising his thumb and squinting his eyes even more as he smiled.
At a certain moment, a blonde woman with very fair skin entered the dining room, an Irish woman who owned a vegetarian bar restaurant at the end of the street (The Green Tree). She told us that in her place we could have dinner, or since we had already eaten, have a drink and share a song, a chat with other pilgrims in a pleasant atmosphere.
I went out to sit on one of the chairs next to the door of the hostel, while the light of the sunset turned golden like the fields surrounding the village. To my right, I casually approached a woman who was Finnish, and she told me that she had brought her two nieces to walk the Camino as a gift for their recent high school graduation. I had already seen them around, they were two very fair-haired girls who were always close to Dante, the charming twenty-something son of an Argentine woman named Marta, with whom I also exchanged a few words shortly after.
To my left was sitting José Manuel, a seventy-three-year-old man from Cádiz who said he was doing the Camino in stages. This time he had just started in Burgos and would finish in León. In this way, he combined the Camino Francés with the Vía de la Plata, which he was also walking, alternating them to progress along both in parallel.
Later, I spoke with my wife on the phone. I conveyed to her my enthusiasm for that extraordinary diversity, it was mind-blowing considering that, in addition, we were in a remote Castilian village with poor mobile coverage.
"You won't believe it," I said, "in the room we even have a retired couple performing 'Scenes of Marriage,' it seems like everyone fits in this small hostel."
The truth is that there I coincided for the first time with a few people whom I would continue to greet for a good part of the journey. With some, I didn't even exchange a word, but I would remember that it was in Hornillos where I had initially seen them. And that night, as I got into my sleeping bag, I felt integrated. I didn't even remember the desert crossing.



       In the background, Hornillos del Camino. It looks like a scene from a western movie. Many pilgrims refer to the Castilian plateau (the Burgos-León stretch) as "the desert". This coincides with the second week of the Camino, when the excitement of the newness fades and tiredness and doubts arise.



Sitting outdoors on a bench in Hornillos, we watch all kinds of people pass by. These two playful Italians were pulling their carts singing "O sole mio". And indeed, what sun. They continued on their way despite the blazing afternoon sun.




Emma, the Irish woman from The Green Tree restaurant, inviting the group of Asians in the dining room of the Hornillos hostel to come to her place to have a Guinness. The diversity of people is extraordinary in this lost Castilian village.

11. Hornillos del Camino - Castrojeriz (19.9 km)
For those signed up for breakfast, the manager had everything prepared for us since the day before, so there was no need to come so early. On the dining table, several bowls rested upside down on their saucers. The coffee was instant, you could heat the milk in the microwave, and there were rusks and Maria biscuits.
—Do you want some, Toni? —I said, offering him a cookie.
—Ha ha, no thanks, I already have.
Sitting next to me, Toni was having his own cookies for breakfast (I also had mine in my backpack), but otherwise, he was having the same as me because we had offered him some Nescafé from the jar and milk from the carton, there was plenty. The day before, after telling him that I had signed up for breakfast (he didn't), he had suggested that I take a look online at a user's review of it.
I was a little angry; not because of the money (or not only), but because others had been smarter than me. But oh well, I told myself, these things could happen from the moment I had decided not to spend time looking at reviews. However, for Toni, that wasn't the issue. He believed that the public hostel had to be, precisely, the place where that spirit of solidarity that was being lost on the Camino should be manifested, a space to share (he was the first to offer his food); that's why, that morning, he saw no problem in having breakfast with everyone and everything, even without having paid.
And in this same line of sharing what there is, he was a devotee of the exchange drawers that almost all hostels installed in some corner along with the motto: "Leave what you don't need, take what you need." He always took a look at them. (A few days earlier, in one of these places, he had picked up some insoles for his sneakers). Since there was also one in Hornillos, after breakfast I waited for Toni to leave before approaching with my raincoat in hand to the corner where this box was located. The weather forecast for the next few days was all sunny, so I carefully placed my beloved raincoat there, perfectly folded. Without being ceremonious, I wanted my gesture to be like an offering, because I felt sorry to give away a garment that had accompanied me for years. But it was the only thing in my backpack that could be considered a "just in case." I would figure out what to do in case bad weather caught up with me in Bierzo or Galicia.
I set off before dawn, like practically everyone else. I was starting to enjoy going out at night with the stars, until it started to get light and the flashlight was no longer needed, and then the sky turned red and finally the sun appeared. The dirt and gravel road was white and surrounded by the desert landscape of the harvested cereal fields. Stones removed by farmers from their crops accumulated at the edges; with them, the pilgrims, in a joint and anonymous action, had been building small mounds that gave the road a sacred character.
After a terrain undulation, a gentle hollow opened up at the bottom, with a beautiful grove indicating the presence of a stream. That must be the well-known refuge of San Bol. That greenery marked an oasis in the middle of the desert, and yet, upon reaching the fork, I did not cover the two hundred and fifty meters that separated me from it to take a look.
But the thing is, I was going very slowly and didn't want to walk more than strictly necessary. I thought I was noticing the effect of going lighter without the six hundred grams of the raincoat, because my foot didn't hurt as much anymore. Besides, I wasn't carrying more food than a couple of pieces of fruit and had left the hostel with the water bottle half full.
In Hontanas, due to my eagerness to have a good lunch, I almost went into the first bar that was offered to the pilgrim, one that had a beautiful terrace at the entrance of the town. But I remembered that unwritten rule for tourist places that says you have to go to the second one, never the first. So I continued a little further and in one called El Puntido, I had a portion of tortilla with a café con leche.
At the exit of the town, I noticed the number of swallows flying in large flocks above the houses. Despite the good weather, they were getting ready to migrate, as autumn was already upon us.
A little further on, I heard someone calling me from behind. It was Toni, who was coming almost running, all sweaty with the visor of his cap turned backwards and with the cane as if it were a spear. He seemed to be in combat mode.
—"But what happened to you?" I asked, surprised that he had fallen behind.
"Nothing, when we left Hornillos I was talking to Marta, the Argentine, and I'm sure we missed some arrows because we got lost," he said, his voice interrupted by the effort.
Now I had to make up for lost time and he passed me without slowing down his speed at any moment, as if he were participating in a long-distance race.
A little further on, the dirt road gave way to a county road flanked by trees in a fertile area next to a stream. "And suddenly the miracle of San Antón occurs," writes Gregorio Morán in his book Never Will I Reach Santiago:
[...] the remains of a medieval convent. The highway cuts through it in such a way that cars and pedestrians must pass under that pointed arch, brushing against the gothic ruins in a pitiful state, inseparable from the road to which they lend an air of Bécquer's legend or a traveler's print a la Byron. A 20th-century road passing under a 14th-century ecclesial arcade! The dream of a mad architect.
Here I did deviate a few meters to see the ruins from the inside. I walked along the semi-ruined walls of the convent until I found the entrance to what used to be the church and is now an open-air courtyard with gravel floor, tables, benches, and some vegetation. Against the interior walls stood some small buildings, perhaps old sheds that had been restored to now serve as a shelter. It was closed when I arrived, but there was a handwritten note hanging from the door that said:
Welcome. There are 12 beds, communal dinner and breakfast. There is no electricity. But there is the magic of this gem. If you want to stay, sign up on the list. We'll be back later.
It was signed by "The hospitaleras," and on the sheet they had drawn emoticons of smiling faces, hearts, and a peace symbol. Two people had already signed up, one of them perhaps being the young man who was resting lying on one of the tables. Otherwise, I was alone. I sat on some steps that must have once served to access the church altar. Chamber music was playing in the background at a very low volume, no idea where it was coming from. I stayed there for a while, absorbing that calmness and reading online about the history of that place.
In the Middle Ages, the monks of that convent treated those affected by "St. Anthony's fire," also known as "hell's fire," a disease caused by consuming bread contaminated with a fungus, ergot. The only known remedy at that time was to go on a pilgrimage to Santiago, for the care provided in places like this and because they replaced rye bread (the most contaminated and common in Europe) with clean wheat bread. Poisoning by the fungus was like a bad trip after taking a tab (hence the hell reference), followed by gangrene in the limbs and mutilations.
I stopped reading. I returned to the road and discovered that the music I had been hearing was from a bar with a terrace set up in a courtyard in front of the convent. There was no one there either. The problem was that all of this was very close to Castrojeriz and had to compete with people's eagerness to finish the stage. The town was within sight, and yes, it happened to me as always in these cases: the last stretch seemed endless to me.
"Get a move on, there are only a few spots left," Pascual urged me when he saw me arriving at the hostel at my own pace. He said it with the reprimanding tone of a father calling his child's attention.
Pascual, the retired man from the hostel in Hornillos, was a Valencian who the day before had entertained us with typical scenes of an elderly Spanish couple. Amparo, his wife, stood preparing dinner, making the salad while heating up the main course, while he sat at the table with headphones on, as he had missed the Champions League match. In the room, he narrated everything he did, what needed to be done, almost as if he was telling himself rather than his wife, who remained silent. It was about things like charging the phone, having a blanket handy in case it got cold at night, remembering to apply cream...; and also recounting how well things were going for them as a result of their foresight and good judgment. Surely, at family gatherings, he played the role of the "brother-in-law" very well.
That "get a move on" comment really upset me, how could he know how I was feeling that day. But in that advice (which resonated in me as a warning) his uncontrollable need to control reality, even that of others, was also evident, to prevent it from hurting us. Because at the hostel in Castrojeriz we were practically the same people as in Hornillos, which already made us a family.
After dinner, at dusk, I sat down on one of the benches with tables outside. I went out with my notebook to see if I could write, although there were many people enjoying the cool evening and the Spaniards were chatting loudly from one side of the terrace to the other. I took off my sandals to let some air in my feet, and at one point, Pascual noticed and exclaimed in alarm:
—But have you seen how swollen your foot is?
Indeed, it was a bit swollen, it had been like that for a few days, but it didn't seem like a big deal to me. José Manuel, the man from Cádiz, approached me:
—Kid, but if it's about to burst. Doesn't it hurt?
—But what are you doing without putting on ice? —Pascual retorted immediately.
I was right. In the freezer of the refrigerator there were gel packs to apply cold, and I hadn't even considered it, out of ignorance, neglect, and ultimately, fear of admitting my condition.
And then they started to scare me. Pascual told me to rest for a couple of days, to go see the doctor, that if the swelling didn't go down immediately, it would burst and I would have to go home.
"And you ran out of the Way," he added conclusively, as if to say: Do you see what happens?
Furthermore, he should do like his wife and he did, who sent the backpacks with Jacotrans to avoid causing pain to their feet, I didn't know how well they were doing.
José Manuel, on his part, seeing that the Achilles tendon area was swollen and that I also had some pain there, told me to go straight home.
—Go home, listen to me, the same thing happened to me, I went home and in two or three days I was fine. Go home —he repeated—, get better and then come back and continue the Camino, listen to me, it's the best thing to do.
"Come on, take off that ice already," Pascual told me after a while with the bag stuck to my foot; I noticed a hint of disdain in his gesture, as if he were talking to a child to whom he had to explain everything.
I retired to my bunk feeling a little disheartened. Perhaps they were right and I couldn't go on. Even though it wasn't even nine o'clock yet, I lay down in bed ready to fall asleep.
Shortly after, Toni appeared, who that night was once again below, as the bunk bed neighbor.
"Here, put this cream on your foot," he said, handing me a tube. "And don't pay any attention to them. The further south you go, the more exaggerated they get."
He recommended that I rest and take it easy the next day to see how it goes.
—And don't overthink it, it's even worse.
"Besides," he added, "worst case scenario, you can always amputate the foot."
While waiting to fall asleep, I remember consoling myself by thinking that, despite how much everyone seemed to know, only I had stopped to visit the inner courtyard of the convent of San Antón that day.



Ruins of the convent of San Antón. On the left, the pilgrim shelter attached to the walls. "No electricity," says the sign on the door, "but there is the magic of this gem." They used to serve a communal dinner, I imagine by candlelight. I should have stayed. But I decided to keep going. It is with the mystery of these decisions that one shapes their own Camino.



Common room at the municipal hostel in Castrojeriz. Indeed, it is not a hotel. How do you handle sleeping all together, men and women, strangers, snorers? The only thing I can say is that you get into the dynamics, and arriving exhausted helps not to be aware and to rest, which is what it's all about.
12. Castrojeriz - Frómista (24.7 km)
At the Castrojeriz hostel, breakfast was by donation. Almost everyone had already left or was about to when I went to the dining room to have a cup of coffee with milk from the coffee maker and what was left of the bread and jam. I noticed a small bookshelf next to the table. In almost every hostel, there was a mini-library with novels in different languages, well-worn and left there by pilgrims. I hadn't brought any books from home because of the weight and also because it wasn't certain that I would read them. Good thing, because I would have had to leave it behind like those next to me now. There was one that was a pilgrim's diary, a self-published one. I flipped through it. In the chapter dedicated to that day's stage, it said that it was worth getting up early to not miss the sunrise from the Alto de Mostelares.
I left the hostel around seven and arrived at Alto just in time to see it, around eight. I realized that in my case, and at that point in September, it was just the opposite of what I had read: thanks to not having gotten up too early, I was able to appreciate the scenery at the moment the sun was rising. At the top, there were about ten people admiring the magnificent views. Where were those who had slept in my hostel? I didn't see anyone I knew. Some must have been well ahead on the stage, which meant they had passed through there still in the dark. The Korean group had left at four in the morning, several alarm clocks had gone off at five, and by six practically everyone was getting ready. Definitely, the phenomenon of early risers and the eagerness to arrive early at the destination was something I hadn't anticipated before the trip. It was said to be to avoid the heat. Or maybe it was just that, as everyone woke up because of a few, people set off on the road in the early hours for lack of anything better to do. I think there was also some collective hysteria, for those of us going to public hostels there was also some fear of arriving late and finding them full. That was what was happening to me. But now I had to go slowly because of my injured foot, and thanks to that, I was able to enjoy the sunrise at Alto de Mostelares. A dreamlike landscape, with mist in the valley and the semi-desert hills starting to be touched by the sun. I approached a small pile of stones holding a cross. From the cross hung scraps of multicolored fabric that gave the place a Tibetan air. There was no wind blowing. Among the stones were little pieces of paper with small texts and poems, as well as some reminders with the photo of someone who had recently passed away. I thought about the number of people who in a searching attitude had made this same journey before me; I felt close to them. I don't believe in abstract energies, but perhaps due to suggestion, I do think that there are places and moments that foster certain moods. I sat on some rocks for a few minutes. Then I took several photos and continued the route through a typical landscape of the Castilian plateau fields.
I arrived at the hermitage of San Nicolás, located just before the bridge over the Pisuerga River, on the border between the provinces of Burgos and Palencia. At the entrance to the church, they had displayed a large Italian flag. The Confraternita di San Jacobo di Compostella, an association from Perugia, was in charge of managing the hostel set up inside the Romanesque temple. I peeked inside to see it, but I heard loud Italian voices and felt like I was intruding on someone else's space, so I didn't go in.
Coincidentally that same day, a little further on, I saw another flag, this time Korean. Despite the great diversity of nationalities represented in this pilgrimage space, there were hardly any flags to be seen, which is why they caught my attention, as if they didn't belong. At most, there were those who wore a tiny insignia sewn onto their backpack, like a sticker on the back of a car. Therefore, when suddenly a Korean man overtook me on the right at full speed, with his country's flag on his back and draped around his neck, in the way athletes do when they run around the stadium after winning a race, I couldn't help but laugh and quickly took a photo of him.
I realized that I barely felt any pain. Maybe Toni's cream was starting to take effect on me, I had also applied it in the morning before leaving. When putting on my shoes, I decided to leave one almost untied, to give my foot a break, since I was going to walk very slowly anyway.
To celebrate the improvement, I took my time having lunch with a café con leche and a slice of Spanish omelette in Itero de la Vega. And so, little by little, through a landscape of yellow fields and under a scorching sun, I reached the stretch that runs alongside the Canal de Castilla under the intermittent shade of the trees. The mere sight of the water was refreshing because, in addition, it announced the proximity of the end of the stage. It was almost two in the afternoon and at that time very few pilgrims were seen. In fact, almost no one was walking anymore. Not a good sign. And then, just as it happened to me the day I was heading to San Juan de Ortega, ominous thoughts related to the availability of accommodation in Frómista invaded me. If I was practically walking alone at that time, it was undoubtedly because everyone had already arrived. And if the day before I took one of the last spots in the municipal hostel in Castrojeriz, why wouldn't I find the one in Frómista full today, arriving later? Just like that time, I started to convince myself that I would sleep outside: upon arrival, I would find the "Completo/Full" sign and at reception they would send me to some other private hostel in the town ("If you want, I can call and reserve a spot for you," the hostel worker would suggest, "No!" I would say, disgruntled, "I don't make reservations!"), and when I went there, I would find it equally full, and then I would return to the municipal hostel and playing the victim, I would ask to at least be allowed to shower, and then I would make people like José Manuel, the man from Cádiz, or Pascual, the man from Valencia, feel guilty for their unsupportive attitude towards me, who was injured and couldn't run like them, and then someone would lend me a mat so I could sleep in the hostel's garden, because it would be very pleasant at night and it wouldn't be so bad, finally I would bivouac.
There were plenty of spots. I breathed. Anyone could understand it. Apparently, people had spread out to other towns (Toni, for example, had gone as far as the next one, and some Asian women carrying heavy backpacks had stayed in the previous one). On the other hand, the hostel in Frómista was bigger, something I hadn't considered. The hospitalera assigned me a bunk bed in a small room where I would sleep with five other people.
At five o'clock, the pharmacy in Frómista opened, and I went there promptly to get some anti-inflammatory cream like the one Toni had left me the day before. Besides, I wanted someone who really knew about these things to take a look at my foot; I was tired of so many hostel pseudo-experts who "know" and tell you what you should do.
"Of course, of course, how could it be otherwise, everyone knows and is perfectly clear about it," the pharmacist supported me ironically.
He made me sit on a chair. My foot was still slightly swollen, but I could see it was getting better. I told him I didn't understand, that in the last few days I hadn't pushed myself.
"Sure," he replied with the tired gesture of someone who has repeated it hundreds of times, "what happens with you all is that from one day to the next you take on all those kilos, and start walking all those kilometers daily, and still think that the body won't protest. Ha!"
In his white coat, he was a man in his fifties, with a serious expression. I thought that, given the location of his pharmacy, over the years he must have attended to many pilgrims like me. Examining my foot, he asked me if my shoes were the right size. I told him no, that anticipating my feet would swell due to the heat, I had bought sneakers one size larger than I normally wore.
—So you might be tying your shoelaces too tight.
Right! That's it! I saw it clearly as soon as he said it. I had been tying them tightly from the beginning to prevent my foot from dancing inside the shoe and causing friction. In fact, I had hardly needed to use the band-aids and I was congratulating myself because I hadn't gotten any blisters. But I understood that the man had hit the nail on the head because, precisely during that stage, I had been wearing the shoe quite loosely and had noticed a clear improvement.
- Did you pass by the convent of San Antón yesterday?
By saying yes, he explained to me about ergotism, the disease popularly known as St. Anthony's fire or holy fire. Apparently, the fungus, besides causing hallucinations, had vasoconstrictive effects that reduced blood flow to the extremities.
—Exactly what you were causing yourself by tying so tightly. Luckily, the tissue hasn't reached the point of gangrene, so there won't be a need for amputation —he said sarcastically, but without ever altering his serious expression.
He gave me a gel. To reduce the swelling, I had to apply it after soaking my feet in cold water. That was all, that would be enough. I returned to the hostel and grabbed one of the buckets that were used for washing clothes and, after filling it with fresh water at the laundry room, I sat on a chair in the courtyard and soaked my feet. Then I let them dry in the sun for a while and, as I was about to apply the cream, I noticed a little wound that had started to appear on the side, near the heel. It was my first blister.



I watch the sunrise from Alto de Mostelares thanks to not having gotten up too early. Most of my hostel companions have missed it. It's a bit crazy, some get up at four or five and do a good part of the stage at night, like zombies with flashlights. They say it's to avoid the heat. "And the landscape?" you ask. "The stars!" they answer.



At Alto de Mostelares, the small mounds of stones that can be seen along the Way could not be missing (the largest of which would be Cruz de Ferro). Passing pilgrims contribute a stone or leave a message, a poem, a photo, an object in them. It is a way to communicate something, almost always a pain.



A Korean with his country's flag on his back overtakes me on the right. It's not a common sight, flags are hardly ever seen. And this is something magnificent considering the variety of countries the pilgrims come from. It's moving to think that so many diverse people can share an activity without needing to emphasize their national identity.



The Canal de Castilla was built to transport goods. But one thing led to another, and it was overtaken by the train, rendering the canal obsolete before it was fully completed. Nowadays, completely sidelined, it is used for boat rides and to refresh the view of the walker who arrives in Frómista.
13. Frómista - Carrión de los Condes (18.8 km)
We were six in the small room of the Frómista hostel where I spent the night. Under my bunk was Pilar, a lady from Burgos in her sixties who claimed to walk some stretch of the Camino every year. She enjoyed chatting and, before going to bed, she gave me her recipe to prevent swollen feet and blisters, as she was also an expert. There were also two Italian women, a mother and daughter, and a middle-aged robust Dutch couple who had taken over two lower bunks.
As soon as the light went out, the man started snoring loudly. They were the loudest snores I had ever heard, frightening, I would even say they made the walls of the small room tremble. I immediately became concerned because it was clear that it would be impossible to sleep like that. Pilar made the appropriate clicking noises with her tongue, but the man didn't flinch, he was deeply asleep. The discomfort in the air was increasing, more and more sighs and snorts could be heard. The Italian mother, who was in the bunk above the snorer, pounded on the wall. Moreover, it was unbearably hot, I was in my underwear on top of my sleeping bag and, with sweat, the fabric stuck to my back. The bunk bed frames creaked because we couldn't stop tossing and turning in bed. The Dutch woman did nothing because she fell asleep and also started snoring, although less than her husband. Pilar ranted aloud saying that it was unbearable. The young Italian put on headphones to listen to music at full volume. Her mother left the room slamming the door.
I cursed that man, how could he think of sharing such a small room? I had heard that in some hostels they asked you if you were a professional snorer, because they had rooms reserved for them. And it was at that moment when I realized: I snored too. I knew it because of my wife, of course, and also because Toni had hinted at it in Salvatierra. A lot, a little? I wasn't sure; I supposed not so much, although it would depend on the night. And then I worried about falling asleep and starting to snore too, that would be too much for Pilar and the Italians. But I needed to rest, the next day a new hike awaited me and if I didn't rest my foot would suffer. I started to have defeatist thoughts: the poor sleep in hostels was going to finish me off and send me back home. I felt trapped. I missed some earplugs, I didn't have them with me because they bothered me. And then, out of sheer desperation, it occurred to me to make a couple of small balls with the only thing I had at hand: a tissue. As soon as I inserted them into my ear canals, the snoring faded into the background and was replaced by the rhythmic sound of my breathing. I fell asleep instantly, I was exhausted.
I woke up at six, feeling rested. I had slept like a log. I noticed my mouth was very dry, oh. And, besides, I was lying on my back. I got scared: I must have snored too. The Dutch people, using a flashlight, were gathering their things to leave stealthily. Pilar and the Italian girls seemed to be sleeping peacefully. I got off the bunk bed trying to make as little noise as possible with the intention of sneaking away. Minutes later, in the hallway, while I was tying (not too tight) my shoelaces, suddenly the door of the room opened. It was Pilar, with huge dark circles under her eyes. You caught me.
"What a night, I haven't slept a wink," he said. "It's been too much, hasn't it?"
—Well, yes —I said timidly.
Then she realized my discomfort.
"Because you have also snored," that "you" sounded like a gunshot to me, "but nothing to do with that man's snoring."
Phew, I felt some relief.
After that, I never saw Pilar again. I saw the Italian women occasionally along the way, I felt embarrassed to greet them, but judging by their faces, they didn't seem to hold a grudge against me. As for the Dutch, I did come across them again, later on.
The path between Frómista and Carrión de los Condes was a trail with long straight stretches next to a road that connected several villages in the Tierra de Campos region. The route was regularly marked with milestones bearing a yellow scallop shell on a blue background, and although it was not paved, it reminded me of the bike paths in my homeland, perhaps because later in the morning I crossed paths with some ladies who had gone out for a walk in the opposite direction to the pilgrims.
Shortly after, I caught up with the Taiwanese woman I had met at the Asian dining room of the Hornillos hostel, named Shan Lee (or something similar). She was walking too slowly, taking short steps with the help of her two walking sticks, methodical and without diverting her gaze from the path. She shielded herself from the sun with long pants and a long-sleeved shirt that even covered the back of her hands. She had an air of an oriental peasant with her hat, which, although not conical, she wore pulled down low with the brim falling all around. Her bulky backpack must have been excessively heavy for how petite she was, because with each step she took, it swayed from side to side giving her body a small shake.
Upon reaching her, I greeted her and, when I asked her how she was doing, she told me she had blisters and they were hurting a lot. That's when I realized that I was feeling good for the first time in almost a week and I felt sorry for her. I told her to hang in there, as the stage was very short and simple, and that we would see each other later at the hostel.
I left her behind, and a few kilometers further on I began to see in the distance the last village before reaching Carrión de los Condes. The walk was turning into a stroll, I couldn't believe it. As I advanced, the immense mass of the church of that village caught my attention, with a giant rose window and dimensions disproportionate to the surrounding houses. That was Villalcázar de Sirga and upon reaching its height, I was clear that it was worth visiting. But for that, one had to deviate to the village, just two hundred meters away, because the Camino de Santiago continued straight along the road. And once again, the thought crossed my mind not to do it and to follow the stream of pilgrims who were ahead of me looking for the end of the stage, about five kilometers away. It was like the force of a river whose current drags you. But no, I said to myself, that day I felt good and I took it as a moral obligation, so I managed to get out of its course and spent an hour visiting the monument and then having my coffee with milk and a slice of tortilla at the bar in front of the church.
Then I returned to the waters of the stream and, as I was reaching the end, I caught up with Shan Lee again, who was still moving forward with her short steps. Her contorted face showed suffering, and I decided to accompany her for the last few meters to the hostel. On the streets of Carrión de los Condes, we ran into Toni, who had already settled in, showered, combed his hair, and was heading to a supermarket.
"Come on, I'll accompany you to the hostel," he said. And addressing Shan Lee, "And you, give me the backpack, I'll carry it for you."
The girl told him it wasn't necessary, "no problem, thank you".
—What no problem? But if you can't even handle your own soul, please —he insisted.
The truth is that despite his practically non-existent English, Toni managed to communicate and had something that could be called "charm", especially with girls. But Shan Lee didn't seem to be up for nonsense, and at most we must have seemed trustworthy enough to her, because she handed over the backpack with a polite smile (or maybe it was a grimace of pain).
"Damn, what do you have in here?" Toni said as he checked the weight of the backpack, which he initially hung casually from one strap, but then had to put on straight using both because "it was going to screw up his shoulder."
At the Espíritu Santo shelter, located within the convent of the congregation of the Daughters of Charity nuns, everything was perfectly organized. After check-in, a nun would accompany the pilgrims to assign them a bed (they were not bunk beds, but regular beds!) and show them around the facilities, speaking loudly so that foreign visitors who did not speak Spanish could also understand.
That day had gone well; the stage had been short and I had walked at my own pace, carefully and comfortably. Besides, I had taken my time to visit a church and still had arrived at the hostel at a reasonable hour. I thought that's how it should always be. After shaving, showering, applying cream to my feet, washing and hanging my clothes, it was still lunchtime, so I went out to look for a restaurant with a set menu. Once I had eaten, I returned to the room to rest in bed. And it was a little later, when I got up with the intention of writing at the table in the center of the dormitory, that I got a fright: there he was, just a couple of beds away: the Dutch snorer from Frómista. By that time the pharmacy must have been open, so I rushed out to buy some good earplugs.
I spent the afternoon doing a bit of sightseeing in Carrión de los Condes, I visited the monastery of San Zoilo. On my way back to the hostel, I settled at one of the tables with chairs in the courtyard of the convent. It had gotten a bit late by Camino standards, people were retiring. It seemed to me that it was getting dark earlier than usual, you could tell the day was getting shorter. Sitting a few tables away was the Italian with long gray beards who, when passing through Hornillos, sang "O sole mio" for everyone. He was alone and serious, with his feet in a bucket of water, he was the very image of desolation. Merry nights, sad mornings (or rather the other way around), I thought, remembering the revelry I had that day.
Shan Lee appeared and sat with me at the table. She had a different look, said everything was under control, and that we could continue the next day. At noon, when we arrived at the hostel, I had suggested accompanying her to the health center, but apparently it was not necessary. Now she was smiling and dressed in light clothes and flip-flops, like a vacationer. I asked her if she knew where Toni was.
—He went to mass with the Japanese women —he told me.
Wow, it seems that the man had indeed become pious, wanting to receive the pilgrim's blessing. It would be Emika and her friend, of course, who were interested in attending, and Toni would have offered to accompany them. A true gentleman.
—"And how are you doing? Have you come across many Chinese people on the Camino?" I asked.
I had the impression that she was a bit lonely, although it might just be because of her shyness.
—Very few —he replied.
—Thank goodness.
He furrowed his brow, not understanding. He asked me why I said that.
—Because if the Chinese start coming like the Koreans do, the Camino is over. There's no room.
By letting the remark slip, I had come off a bit brusque, but Shan Lee didn't take it personally. She didn't even remind me that she was Taiwanese.
—I have read the famous book by the Korean author that made the Camino popular in Korea, it has been translated into Chinese.
Wow, how scary, I thought. But this time I didn't say anything. That, the reading of that book that had seduced so many Koreans, explained his presence there. Then he added that he was taking a break in his life.
"I am between jobs," he said.
Although it sounds odd in Spanish, "in between jobs" was the expression he used, something like "between one job and the next."
—I do too —I said, and the truth is that the way he put it sounded good to me.
And besides, it was true. I had also opened a parenthesis in my life. The problem was that I didn't know how to close it.



Between Frómista and Carrión, there is a dirt path next to the road and a tunnel made through a weeping willow. It is a good example of two things that characterize the Camino: its basic, unpaved nature, and also the feeling that there is "someone" behind it who takes care of its maintenance, helping the pilgrim.
14. Carrión - Terradillos de los Templarios (26.3 km)
I don't know if there were any snoring noises in the convent dormitory, because I put in earplugs as soon as I got into my sleeping bag and all was quiet. In the morning, I was one of the last to leave the room, even though it was still very early. Toni was waiting for me at the door, but we only went together to the first bar we found open in Carrión itself. There, we had coffee and as we left, I exaggerated a very slow pace to help him take off.
The stage had a particularity: the first section consisted of an endless straight of about seventeen kilometers where there was no town, nothing. It turned out to be very monotonous because there was nothing but flat countryside around. I walked and walked, and by the time it took me to cover it, I calculated that I was going at four kilometers per hour, apparently quite slow because I was constantly being overtaken.
So, after about four hours of walking along a dirt track, the last of them under a scorching sun, I was overjoyed to finally spot a bell tower in the distance. Indeed, that was Calzadilla de la Cueza, but it wasn't until I reached its level that I saw the houses because the village was nestled in a hollow.
At the entrance there were two establishments. I chose the one on the right, which seemed less crowded, a bar-hostel-restaurant called Los Canarios. I ordered a small beer with a slice of Spanish omelette, and when a while later I went to the bar to pay, I noticed the ads that had been pinned with thumbtacks to a cork board on the wall. Among them, there was a paper napkin with the following poem written in pen:
From the pit where the town lies,
the bell tower looms in the distance
between fields of a calm sea of land,
like in murky waters of a swamp.
Piece of poem that the inspired one who had passed by before me had marked. It resonated throughout when reading it. I took a picture of it, and when I read these verses again later, I had the feeling that, despite their seriousness, they quite accurately reflected what I had seen upon arriving in Calzadilla de la Cueza that morning.
Around two in the afternoon, I arrived at Terradillos de los Templarios and headed to the Jacques de Molay hostel (named in honor of the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar), a name that sounded very chic in the middle of the Castilian wasteland. At the reception, two young Germans who had arrived a little earlier were waiting for me. The hospitalera hung up the phone and confirmed to them that at the Moratinos hostel, just over three kilometers away, they had available beds for them. They left.
"Have you made a reservation?" the woman asked me next.
—No.
—Well, then you get the last spot.
"Well, what a shame. There's no way I'm staying out," I thought sarcastically (once I had the bed secured).
"How great, how lucky I am," I replied nonetheless.
The shocking thing was that, for once, it caught me off guard, because, for some reason, I hadn't anticipated that contingency. And even though Terradillos was a delicate stage end for someone on a plan like mine, because the two hostels in the town were private and required a reservation. The hospitalera explained that September had become the busiest month ("just yesterday, by one o'clock, the hostel was already full").
I was assigned a top bunk in a small room for eight that reminded me of the one in Frómista. There didn't seem to be anyone in the bottom bunk.
- Can I take the one downstairs? - I asked.
—No, I have it reserved.
It turns out it was for José Manuel, the man from Cádiz, who showed up shortly after. I had seen him in the previous town, Ledigos, eating a roast lamb while I was having a beer at the bar before tackling the end of the stage. José Manuel was a notorious snorer, but neither that, nor the small room, nor the fact that I had almost run out of space in the hostel bothered me that time. Perhaps because I had a lot to take care of, among other things eating, as it was late. But after shaving, showering, putting cream on my feet, washing and hanging the clothes, I lay down on the bunk bed for a moment and fell asleep.
When I woke up in the middle of the afternoon, I was no longer hungry. I decided to wait for dinner with Toni and went out with the intention of seeing the town and finding a cool and peaceful place to write. But in Terradillos there was nothing at all, I walked around its deserted streets with adobe houses and didn't find a bar or any store, just a multipurpose building that was the social center for the few people left in the town. From the facade of the church hung a plaque with almost faded inscriptions of those who fell for God and for Spain (with the Joseantonian rubric: "Presentes!"). The parish provided shade in its back part to a small park with tables, and there I sat down and opened my notebook to take notes.
Shortly after, I heard some footsteps; I looked up and saw a tall and sturdy pilgrim crossing the park, fair-skinned with two blonde braids intertwined, the same one I had been coinciding with in the hostels for days, although we had never spoken. We greeted each other, and as I returned to my notebook, I heard her say to me:
-Excuse me for bothering you, do you know if there is any store open around here?
His English seemed good, although he was not a native speaker, and from his accent I couldn't deduce where that young woman might be from.
—I'm afraid not, the only store is the one inside the hostel, I think they open at five thirty.
I told her where Jacques de Molay was located. She was staying at the other hostel in the village, one that (inevitably) was called The Templars.
"I almost got left out, I don't like those damn private hostels," he said out of the blue.
I smiled. I told him that the same thing had happened to me.
—But I don't like them not because I could have been left out, that would have annoyed me, but, truth be told, it's good for me to fend for myself from time to time, because what I need is not to be given any facilities, you know? —he added as he took a seat at the other end of the table—. No places where I can make a reservation and where they offer me to stay and rest for an extra day if I need it, which I would, believe me. Because, how can I really know if I need it? You have no idea how much I value public hostels, the sketchier the better, especially because they force me to get up in the morning, everyone out by eight.
Well, I did need to talk. He took a pause to bring a cigarette to his mouth, which he took from a cigarette case. Suddenly, it came to my mind when I had last seen her: it had been that same morning, in the bedroom of the convent in Carrión de los Condes: if I was one of the last to leave, she had to be the very last, because when I left she was still in bed, stretching.
Fortunately, it was almost time for the store to open, so I suggested we head there. She told me her name was Irena and that she was Russian. This was something I definitely didn't expect. Indeed, her braids had sounded Slavic to me. I would have liked to ask her what a Russian was doing there, but on the way, she kept telling me her stories non-stop, and when she started ranting about the permissive education she had received from her well-off parents and I don't know what else, that's when I tuned out.
Later on, I reflected on the lack of comfort that Irena had mentioned to me. In my case, it wasn't that I needed someone to get me out of bed, my anxiety took care of that, not even sleeping in a luxury hotel would have stopped me from fulfilling my duty as a pilgrim. But in the daily routine of the hostel, there was something that helped: it didn't matter if I slept poorly, felt tired, or had sore feet. It wouldn't have mattered if the weather was bad. In any case, I had to get up from the bunk bed, pack everything up, and head out. Regardless of how the previous day had gone, I got ready and thus had the opportunity to see how things were going in the reality of the new day. Whether good or bad, decisions were made on the spot, leaving little room for conjecture, without space for unfounded worries. I wondered if this was why that day I let myself go without anticipating that Jacques de Molay could be full, or that I wasn't worrying about the presence of snorers in the small room where I was going to sleep that night.
The small hostel store was very poorly stocked, there was nothing but drinks, cookies, bread, cheese, cold cuts, and a few cans. The issue was that the hostel's kitchen couldn't be used because it was reserved for the restaurant. I was starving and decided not to buy anything to gobble up the €10 menu they offered. Toni, however, was not willing to go along with it and bought a can of beans with chorizo intending to have them for dinner there with me. At six o'clock, the dining room opened and we were the first ones to sit at a table. There were no problems: the waitress, after taking my order (rice soup, trout, flan), took Toni's can to the kitchen and returned its contents to him in a succulent steaming plate. I suggested sharing everything, but he refused, except for the wine.
After dinner, we went to the multipurpose building in the town to see if they would serve us some beer. There were elderly people playing cards, but also a group of young people from the region getting ready for the upcoming Saturday night. We sat outside with the small bottles. It was still warm even though it was getting dark. Next to us, a little dog was dozing off and, from time to time, would raise its head, opening its mouth to catch and eat the flies buzzing around it.
Toni began to tell me about the unique characters he had met on his travels along the Camino de Santiago, those who had decided to stay and live there.
"They are people who 'live on the Way,'" he told me. "That's how they themselves put it, that at a certain moment in their lives they set out on the Way and stayed to live on it."
But Toni was not referring to the more or less idealistic entrepreneurs who had set up a hostel believing in the solidarity values of the Camino and, at the same time, as a way to make a living. The Jacques de Molay was a good example of this, its owner had been running it since the nineties. No, what attracted him were the losers with a free and therefore peculiar personality, those who, with barely any resources, had found refuge on the Camino and were getting by oblivious to the dominant values in society.
—In the stage the day after tomorrow, in Reliegos, you will find the Elvis bar, you have to go in there, where Sinín is.
A guy wearing a beret, Sinín, apparently didn't care if you consumed or not, you could take food from outside if you wanted because the important thing was that the pilgrims rested while listening to the music of Elvis Presley, in a place that was an old house full of inscriptions and graffiti inside and out.
—And another one of the mythical ones is the Phoenix Hostel, in Villafranca del Bierzo, now that's an authentic hostel on the Camino, you'll see.
He also told me about Paco, the hospitalero of Castrojeriz, a guy of the same kind. Apparently, he let his beard grow throughout the year and in winter he made his annual pilgrimage to Santiago, and then, in Finisterre, he would cut it and burn it as in an esoteric ritual. When we were in Castrojeriz, I was worried about my swollen foot and, unfortunately, I didn't go with Toni, who went with this Paco to have some beers at the bar.
—And he told me that there was no problem, that if I wanted to stay for a while at the shelter, that there was no issue for him, that I would have a bed in exchange for helping with the shelter's tasks, and that we would share the donations.
—Toni, the hospitalero —I said.
It didn't seem to me that he was serious, although it was clear that he was attracted to the idea of ​​staying to live on the Camino, perhaps as an idealized dream. He must have felt good recreating it while we were having the second bottle of beer on the terrace of the social center of Terradillos. In any case, Toni, who spent a good part of the year doing the Camino de Santiago, in a way, it could be said that he was already living in it.



Jacques de Molay hostel courtyard in Terradillos de los Templarios. There is a sense of camaraderie that encourages conversation. You grab a drink and you're already talking to someone. I came alone to do the Camino, but I had never spoken to so many people before. My everyday identity was left behind and now I am just a pilgrim, like everyone else.

15. Terradillos - Bercianos del Real Camino (23.2 km)
It was still dark when I arrived at the first village after leaving Terradillos early in the morning. Right at the entrance, I headed towards a house surrounded by fields which was the Moratinos hostel-albergue. Outside, on both sides of the door, there were backpacks leaning against the wall. I noticed that one of them belonged to Toni. I took off my backpack and placed it in line next to hers before entering the bar. (I felt like the outsider from a Western movie who arrives in a town and, as he ties his horse's reins in front of the saloon, identifies the other horses and knows who he will find inside).
Indeed, there it was, with an American coffee and a croissant. There were some more pilgrims having breakfast.
"Do you remember that tall guy who took my bunk bed in Hornillos?" he asked me when I sat down next to him with my café con leche, nodding his head towards the other tables.
He was referring to a very tall man to whom he gave up his bunk because he didn't fit in the regular ones. Initially, the large one had been assigned to Toni because, being more comfortable, it was the one given to the first person to arrive at the shelter (the one who made pole). That man was having breakfast there, he had already seen him when he entered.
—Yes, I remember.
—Well, the other day, at the church of Carrión de los Condes, when I went to the pilgrims' mass with the Japanese, I come across him at the altar officiating with the parish priest. He was dressed as a priest! Although, I must say, the skirts were too short for him. Damn, I was shocked, man.
Wow, I told myself the same thing. Definitely, on the Camino de Santiago, you never know who your neighbor is.
—How do you say "cura" in English? —Toni asked me.
—Prist. It is spelled "priest" but pronounced "prist."
- How is Judas Priest?
—Same.
Toni got up, leaving me his phone with the camera ready, and went over to the priest. "You prist?" he asked. The man nodded, and then he asked them to take a picture together. He stood up from the chair: mustache, glasses, gray hair with large temples, shorts, and sportswear: a true Austrian priest. I would have never guessed. Standing side by side, Toni didn't even reach his shoulder. They both raised their thumbs for the picture.
That morning I walked with Toni to the town of Sahagún, halfway through the stage (and also the midpoint of the Camino Francés). My foot was practically healed, but I didn't want to get carried away and make the usual mistake of speeding up to keep up with his pace. So I accompanied him during that first stretch, but I told him that I would continue alone afterwards.
In Sahagún, I remembered it was Sunday because of the shops, which were closed (in the previous small towns it was harder to notice). We headed to a coffee shop-bakery and, before going in, we left our backpacks outside leaning against the glass door, in line with the other pilgrims' backpacks that were inside. In The Way, the character played by Martin Sheen also leaves his outside when entering a bar in Burgos, and it gets stolen. When I saw this scene in the movie, I thought they had forced the script, as it didn't seem believable that someone would leave their things unattended on the street. But there I was, doing exactly the same thing (of course Sahagún was not Burgos). On one hand, it was a practical matter: the bakery was small and there wasn't much space for the bulky backpacks. And on the other hand, it was a Camino tradition: we all did it and by doing it, we felt like one of the group. A kind of signal of trust towards the others, because in any case, there were only pilgrims there.
I arrived in Bercianos del Real Camino around two in the afternoon, in the worst of the heat. A village with old adobe houses, many of them abandoned or serving as sheds. The church bell tower looked like a watchtower because you could see the iron beam structure. Later, I read on the internet that the old church had collapsed on them and they had not finished covering the new one due to lack of money.
Sweaty, I headed to the parish hostel, a restored large house that had been the rectory and still preserved some mud and straw partitions. As soon as I entered the hallway, one of the volunteers welcomed me offering a glass of water that was kept cool in a water jug.
"There goes the punch, a guipuchi," he said after asking me where I was from. It was clear that he was from Bilbao.
There were three volunteers running the hostel, all three wearing yellow t-shirts with the logo of Volunteer Hospitaleros, which was a human figure with arms outstretched in a gesture of offering a hug. There was Marciana, a smiling Brazilian who stamped my credential and took my information to register me. And also an Italian man completely bald who was going to prepare the communal dinner for that night: pasta.
That Sunday afternoon I went out with Toni for a walk, but the sun was scorching in the deserted streets of Bercianos, so we took refuge in a bar. With our drinks, they offered us some chorizo and bread to nibble on that they had on the bar. We left the plate clean, luckily we were the only customers. We ordered another round so they would give us more chorizo. It was good. Then Toni suggested one last round, but dinner time was approaching, so we decided to start heading back.
As soon as the dining room opened, the five Spaniards who were staying at the hostel (out of a total of about forty pilgrims) rushed to sit together. To my left was Toni and to my right was Amparo, Pascual's wife, the Valencian, who sat in front of me and next to José Manuel, the man from Cádiz. At our table, there were others who we completely ignored throughout dinner, as Toni, Pascual, and José Manuel started to exchange jabs, and it was easier to indulge in the chatter and laughter of our little group than to make the effort to be polite with the foreigners in English.
Before serving us dinner, the bald Italian, who was the one taking the lead, reminded us that there was a piggy bank at the reception for us to leave our donation for the accommodation and meals.
"Remember, with what you contribute today, those who come tomorrow will have dinner," he said, reciting what was written on a cardboard attached to the wall.
Next, it was time to sing "The Blessing Rap," whose lyrics were also hanging on the dining room wall. One, two, three... the Italian then started rapping, hitting the table with his hand to keep the beat while the rest of us accompanied him in unison:
This is the rap / of the blessing.
Bless, Lord, the food.
Bless my friends - bless my brothers - bless everyone / who lends you a hand.
Extend your arm / bend it / and with this - you are blessed too.
There were applause and great merriment that immediately died down because there was hunger. They left a bowl of salad in the center of the table and then served each of us a plate of macaroni with tomato sauce and bits of Frankfurt sausage. For dessert, half a banana.
"Well, the ones from yesterday didn't leave much of a donation," said José Manuel. "Could they have been Catalans?"
"No, they would be Andalusians trying to be funny, but without actually being funny," Toni said before putting half a banana in his mouth.
When we finished dinner, the Italian master of ceremonies took the floor again and asked for two volunteers to wash the dishes. The Spaniards, in a synchronized manner, lowered our gaze while turning a deaf ear as a Frenchman and an American offered to do the task.
But before that, he invited us to go out as a group to witness the magnificent sunset that was going to take place over the moor and to celebrate a simple community event. When we got up from the table, Pascual said he was going to the bar to see if they were showing the League match (there was a Valencian derby: Villarreal-Valencia). José Manuel said he would accompany him. The host from Bilbao also excused himself saying something about the Athletic match.
The rest of us headed to a small park adjacent to the hostel, dry and open, from which the horizon could be seen. We sat on benches and on the ground, and remained silent while the sun set. Then we stood up and were asked to form a circle, and with the orange light of dusk, Marciana, the Brazilian hostess, sang a prayer in Portuguese for the pilgrims.
Next, the Italian lit a candle and we passed it around to each other, so that anyone who wanted to could share a few words with the others when it was their turn to hold it. Those who spoke expressed gratitude for being there in those moments, and some remembered loved ones. Fortunately, not everyone spoke up. When it was my turn, I took the candle with both hands as if I were protecting a sacred fire and held it for a moment, gazing at the flame (pretending to silently pray but very aware that I was being watched), before passing it on to the next person, relieved. Throughout the round, several languages were heard, but not Spanish.
To finish, the Italian suggested that we give each other hugs while saying "¡buen Camino!" At my side was a girl who approached me smiling, and we almost bumped into each other because I leaned to my left and she came at me from the same side, that is, from her right. I quickly corrected and leaned to the opposite side, and when we hugged, she pulled me towards her with such force that it startled me a little.
I didn't move from my spot, so I didn't hug others like Toni or Amparo, who also stayed put. But some completed the whole round. Like Marciana, who came up to hug me and the same incident happened as with the previous girl, I didn't understand why it didn't fit right away.
—"But where is your heart?" she scolded me. "Heart to heart," she added, placing her hand on her left chest and then on mine, before joining our hearts in a tight hug.



In Bercianos, after the communal dinner at the hostel, we went to watch the sunset over the moor. We stayed there, in silence, for the duration. It's great that they suggest these things, otherwise you wouldn't do them. They bring significance to the travel experience. Even if afterwards you have to do something else, like share some words or give hugs.
16. Bercianos - Mansilla de las Mulas (26.3 km)
At the Bercianos hostel, in the drawer labeled "Leave what you don't need, take what you need," I found a zamburiña shell, a mollusk that is similar to the scallop but smaller in size and darker in color. It had a small yellow arrow painted on it that was barely visible because it had faded. Perhaps it had been discarded because of that, I imagined they had replaced it with a shiny white scallop shell with the red cross of Santiago, which was the trend. I took the zamburiña and hung it from my backpack with a rubber band. Finally, I had my badge.
I had breakfast, left my donation in the collection box, and after hugging Marciana again (this time properly), who was at the door of the hostel saying goodbye to everyone, I set off with Toni following the arrows into the night in the countryside. There was a full moon and there was no need to turn on the flashlight, it was quite visible. Toni kept talking about this and that, and I remember thinking it was a shame because by listening to what he was saying, I was missing out on a phenomenon that seemed unique. It was so special that even Toni was left speechless when we finally stopped to observe it: in front of us, the lunar disk was turning orange as it approached the Earth in its descent. It was nothing more than a "moonset." But what made it even more spectacular was the fact that behind us, the first rays of the Sun were already pointing. One was rising, the other was setting. We took photos, but they were worthless compared to what we were witnessing. The cameras on our phones were limited, and the Moon appeared tiny in the pictures, not matching the supermoon we were seeing. Upon touching the ground, it disappeared almost immediately, as if it had been swallowed up.
During a stretch, we walked in silence, as if digesting it ourselves. Until we reached El Burgo Ranero (which, for some reason, I got stuck in my head as El Burgo "Rainiero," and I said it a couple of times and Toni added "de Mónaco," making both of us laugh), where we looked for a café and, after having our respective Americano and coffee with milk, each went our separate ways.
At this stage, the appearance of the road and its surroundings remained unchanged for very long stretches: crossing a vast expanse of fields, a straight dirt track marked by footprints, next to a local road where hardly any cars passed. At some point, I stepped onto the pavement to walk more freely on a smoother surface. But I got a big scare when a van from the company Jacotrans (I assume loaded with pilgrims' backpacks) sped past me just a couple of meters away, taking advantage of having the entire straight stretch to itself.
So, for safety reasons, I returned to the dirt road. Its width was such that two people could walk side by side on it. It was a footpath and yet it seemed to have ruts because some vegetation was growing in the middle. We all contributed to reinforcing these two parallel paths, since once they were formed, no one walked on the slight accumulation of gravel and weeds in the center. And looking down, I noticed the dust or white sand that covered it, which was the reason why I had forgotten the original color of my sneakers (figuratively speaking, they were blue). That white floor had a somewhat lunar surface because it was full of footprints, a multitude of shoe sole prints overlapping each other. With my step, I also left my mark there, but it would soon be erased under the ones left by those who came behind.
Another characteristic of these sections was the line of trees that accompanied them. They were still young, but someday they would provide good shade for the pilgrims. In the rest areas, which had tables and a fountain, the trees were older and more leafy. I decided to stop at one where there weren't many people. To the north, the mountains of the Cantabrian range began to be visible. A fine wind was coming from there. Suddenly, I noticed that those who were in the park when I arrived had left and left me alone. I felt a bit cold and put on my jacket. All that could be heard was the gentle breeze moving the branches of the poplars, which were already dropping their first leaves. And I realized that, although it may seem unbelievable, we were already in autumn, and on my journey, I had already covered more than half of it.
In Reliegos, I took a detour down a street to go to Elvis bar, a must-visit according to Toni. Maybe I would even run into him, as he had told me he was planning to grab a bite there to chat with Sinín, the owner of the business, one of those unique inhabitants of the Camino. Besides, I wanted to check if what I had written on the wall inside the bar last time I was there was still in place; apparently, pilgrims leaving inscriptions had become a tradition.
The facade of Elvis was blue and completely covered in graffiti. When I stood in front of it, I had the feeling that the house was looking at me, it was because of the eyes that had been drawn on the two boarded-up windows of the first floor. It looked like a carefree and even a bit crazy place, anarchy was evident, it was clear that there was freedom for everyone to express themselves however they wanted. "WE SPAK ENGLIS" could be read in one of the scribbled texts, and I laughed at the spelling mistakes, wondering if the spoken English of that Sinín place would be at the same level as the one shown in writing. The chairs and tables were set up on the terrace, albeit haphazardly, and there was no one around.
It was closed, "Weekly rest" read a handwritten sheet on the door. It was Monday. What a shame, I wanted to take a look at the inscriptions that people had been leaving and see Sinín himself. Anyway, I noticed that there were also things written on the outside, in marker, and I noted down the following declaration of love:
More damages than years
First, I smiled at your ass,
later I lost my mind over your smile
He passed by here on his way.
You are Santiago
I love you
It must have been curious to walk the Camino being named Santiago. "What's your name?" "Look, it's very easy, I'm named after the saint: Santiago." It would surely be quite original and picturesque to introduce oneself like that, especially to foreign pilgrims. Because in English, no one heard anyone say "The Way of Saint James," but everyone constantly used the expression "The Camino to Santiago," which in my crude way of pronouncing it sounded like "De Camino tu Santiago." I don't know what I had laughed about before, after all, my English was also an "I SPAK ENGLIS."
At the municipal hostel in Mansilla de las Mulas, they stamped my credential and recorded my information in the registration book. Then, I chose an available bunk, laid out my sleeping bag, and after shaving, showering, and applying cream to my feet, before washing and hanging my clothes, I decided to tend to a small blister that was barely bothering me but also wasn't going away.
I had first noticed it in Frómista, the day I had loosened my shoelaces to improve blood circulation in my foot. That had made the inflammation stop for good, but in return, my foot moved more inside the shoe, and precisely that day, due to rubbing, the darn blister appeared. Since then, I had been acting oblivious, ignoring it, hoping it would get bored of me and disappear. But since that hadn't happened, it was time to grab the needle and thread I had in my toiletry bag and deal with the matter.
I sat on my bunk bed, taking advantage of the fact that the dormitory was quite clear at that time. I had never popped a blister before and I didn't want anyone to come and tell me how to do it. Besides, it could be unpleasant to look at. The big problem with common rooms was, obviously, the lack of privacy. I had mentioned this to my wife one of those days when she asked me how I was handling being exposed to the gaze of so many people, men and women, all together, sometimes even a bit crowded. I remembered the vivid impression that the first crowded room in Santo Domingo de la Calzada had on me. But I had quickly gotten used to it, had entered the dynamic. It didn't seem to me that people were very focused on others, because the priority was to rest. And yes, there was dirt, smells, disorder, and lack of decorum, but it was understood that we were pilgrims on the Camino. Therefore, for practical reasons, I immediately started going to the shower in my underwear, although, my boxers were not briefs or white, but black, so that if one didn't pay too much attention, they could pass for shorts. But I digress from what I was telling.
The blister. I had it on the outer edge of my foot. The weight of the backpack had crushed my feet like the tires of an overloaded car, so the edge of the sole rubbed against me more. On Wikipedia, I had read that due to friction, the cells of the top layer of the skin detached from those below, and, like a spring, plasma sprang from the inside filling that bubble called a blister with fluid. The plasma helped regenerate the skin, while cushioning the area to protect it from further damage. But since I had to walk daily, there was a danger that it would burst on the go causing a major breakdown; therefore, sometimes it was better to perform a controlled detonation.
I pricked it with the needle and the clear liquid came out, which I cleaned with a tissue. Then I threaded my needle and took a stitch, letting part of the thread hang so the rest of the fluid could drain through there.
—But what are you doing?
He gave a start, startled. It was Pascual, he startled me, I hadn't heard him come into the bedroom.
—But can't you see that you can get germs on you?
He said I had to use hypodermic needles, the ones they sell at the pharmacy, and no sewing thread. And to apply Betadine to disinfect the wound. And then put a dressing on top to protect it from further rubbing. And to apply vaseline to my foot before walking, so it would slide and no more blisters would come out. And to change my socks as soon as they got wet from sweat, especially if it was very hot, because maceration was the worst. And...
- Okay, okay, okay - I interrupted, overwhelmed by so much advice. My head was spinning.
I didn't do any of that. Exaggerated. The next day, I removed the thread and forgot about the matter, because it healed. And for at least a few days, I didn't have to worry about blisters.



Elvis bar, in Reliegos. A place between casual and crazy. The house looks at you. Places like this, set up by Camino residents, attract, like stories about people who one day decided to change their lives.
17. Mansilla de las Mulas - León (18.5 km)
Around six-thirty in the morning, I headed towards the exit door of the Mansilla hostel and there I found Toni, waiting for someone to depart with. We set off and I decided to walk this stage in his company because the next day we were going to part ways. This was his plan: from León, Toni was going to hike up to Oviedo through the Camino del Salvador, crossing the Cantabrian mountain range. Then he would continue on the Camino Primitivo to reach Santiago. Next, he planned to take a bus to Ferrol to return to Santiago through the Camino Inglés. And then he would head down to Lisbon to walk up the Camino Portugués. All of this before returning home, probably in December, for his sixty-second birthday.
"I said, 'Sounds good.'"
While we were walking, I noticed that he was looking at me, but he didn't find any irony on my face.
Toni must have had bedbugs in his Barcelona home to prolong the trip without wanting to return. What seemed clear was that he felt better walking the Camino, even though he lived with his "partner," as he called her.
—Don't you miss her? —I asked.
—A little. But we're fine. I wouldn't go back to that mess of falling in love and getting married for anything. What a hassle. Do you know what I mean? How nice it is to be in a peaceful relationship.
—But what about the comforts of being at home? I'm already a bit fed up with sleeping in hostels and eating pre-cooked meals.
-Yes, that's tiring. Like the backpack, it's a burden. But what can I tell you, it weighs more on me when I'm lying on the couch doing nothing -he said, quickening his pace and ending the confidence.
Just before Puente Villarente, we entered the cafeteria of an inn called Filosofía (it really was called that) to have coffee. A while later, when we resumed our journey, we ran into Pascual and Amparo, who were walking at a good pace, light without their backpacks, as they were still sending them through Jacotrans. We walked with them, but soon Amparo had to step aside to some bushes, and as we left the couple behind, Toni said to Pascual, "See you later, alligator."
"If it weren't for this one, who's always peeing, no one would have passed us," he replied angrily.
The stage was short and simple, and my foot had healed completely, so I kept up with Toni's pace without any problems. I was comfortable with him, but as always when I accompanied him, I had the feeling of not knowing where we were going. On one occasion, I stopped to take a photo and then he also stopped to wait for me, but since I felt uncomfortable holding him back, I didn't take any more photos throughout the entire journey to León.
Before eleven in the morning, we were waiting for the Benedictine nuns' hostel of Santa María de Carbajal to open, along with some Koreans, the Valencians who had also just arrived, and many other familiar faces from the Camino.
The hostel of the convent was right in the heart of the Barrio Húmedo, so we had it easy to go for tapas towards the evening. But before getting down to business, we took a stroll. Near the Plaza Mayor, we passed by a travel bookstore called Iguazú. I remembered that at the beginning of the summer, I had been there with my wife, when we visited León on vacation. We had such a great time without even realizing it.
"Look, that one is right up my alley," she said to me then, pointing at a book in the shop window.
"I Will Never Make It to Santiago," he found the title amusing. We had seen pilgrims on the streets of León that day, and a little earlier, we had joked about the possibility of doing the Camino together, but my wife didn't feel up to it.
We went in and I took a look at the book. I bought it. And three months later there I was again, in front of the same bookstore, this time walking the Camino and accompanied by a certain Toni. Somehow, that book (or rather the title with its provocative point) was the trigger.
—What if I do it and then tell you about it? —I said to my wife that day, holding the book in my hand.
With the nostalgia of that memory, I continued wandering along with Toni through the Barrio Húmedo until we finally entered a bar. The plan was to have tapas for dinner, the ones they served, so we had to order "cortos" of beer if we wanted to return to the hostel in good shape. And the truth is that we had a great time at that sort of farewell party we celebrated in the bars, drinking, eating, and chatting. Despite the annoyance he sometimes caused me, I had been lucky to meet Toni, because besides being a good companion, he had taught me the ins and outs of the Camino.
-Let's see: the good pilgrim -he said, as if to test me.
In the last few days, we had reviewed the decalogue of the good pilgrim, as he and I understood it, but it seemed important to repeat it once more to have it clear. Between the two of us, we completed the list.
1) The good pilgrim traveled alone. Along the way, he would meet others, but the journey as a whole was done individually.
2) I was traveling on foot. By bike, it was a different kind of experience; the bike pilgrims took less time but passed by many villages without stopping.
3) He carried his backpack. Using the services of Jacotrans turned one into a tourist pilgrim, a "turigrino," as they were called.
4) He used to sleep in public hostels, without making reservations, embracing the motto: "The tourist demands, the pilgrim appreciates."
5) I completed the entire journey at once, with a minimum duration of one month, instead of doing it in stages over several years.
For me, there were three additional points that added intensity to the experience of the Camino de Santiago, but I didn't share them with Toni because I understood that they depended on each person's personal circumstances. These three points brought me a little closer to what the medieval pilgrims must have felt. The first one was having the possibility of starting the journey on foot directly from home. The second one was considering the pilgrimage as something done only once in a lifetime. And the third one (and at this point I felt even more fortunate) was never having been to Santiago de Compostela.
And yet, the experience of the journey showed me how relative everything we had previously thought was. The decalogue of the good pilgrim that Toni and I had put together was not entirely true, or at least not something that should be taken too seriously. As I write this, I remember a young overweight American woman who had fallen behind because she had faced many difficulties during the first stretch of the Camino and, realizing she wouldn't finish in time to catch her flight back home, from Burgos to León she made up for lost time by renting a bike and sending her backpack daily with Jacotrans. I also remember an eighty-year-old Canadian grandmother in San Juan de Ortega waiting for a taxi with her grandson to take them to a hotel they had booked in Burgos ("Eighty years old and today I walked twenty kilometers, what do you think?" she said to me). I also remember the Finnish woman who had brought her two nieces who had just graduated from high school, silently crying in the courtyard of the Jacques de Molay hostel in Terradillos, because the next day she was going home with her feet broken, but promising herself that she would return the following year to that same lost place in the Castilian wasteland to finish her pilgrimage from there.
And, without going any further, there was Toni, going around the Camino more times than a merry-go-round. He must have his reasons. And my wife, why couldn't she try to do it using all the available aids? I myself was willing to break the first rule, the one about going alone, to accompany her if she ever asked me to.
But all of this I matured through the journey. At that moment, as the "shots" were falling, our friendship was exalted in the shared certainties of what was right and what was wrong. At one point, Toni told me that he was sad to part ways with me because, from then on, who knows who he would have beers with. Before the drunkenness showed too much on our faces, we asked a waiter to take a picture of us. It was the only one I took with him: we put our arms around each other's backs and with our beer shots held high, we looked together, so to speak, towards the future. We didn't come out very well. Neither of us were very keen on being in photos.
We returned to the hostel shortly before nine. I was already considering the day over and my intention was to retire to the bunk bed and, with whatever lucidity I had left, select the photos and write the texts for the blog. But at the entrance to the convent, we came across two very young nuns moving swiftly, the skirts of their habits forming flights, informing the pilgrims that the blessing ceremony in the adjacent church was about to begin. We told them that yes, we were going now, and as we went up to the rooms with the intention of dodging them, they followed us from behind, even though in that hostel the men slept separately from the women. But the nuns didn't hold back and went in full force, walking through the bunk bed corridors, tapping the shoulder of anyone pretending to be asleep to explain it in perfect English if necessary.
I was a little annoyed, although with the dizziness from the shorts I let myself go. "These things are not usually done," Toni justified, as he was not one to go to mass unless he was accompanying a young pilgrim. But since we had been caught, that kind of consideration towards those who were giving us shelter that night pushed him as it did me. So we went to the anteroom of the church and there, before entering, the very young nuns explained the guidelines to follow during the ceremony. Out of the over a hundred guests at the hostel, they managed to gather about fifteen. We met the tall Austrian priest and Marta, the Argentine, who had not spoken to Toni since they got lost in the darkness leaving Hornillos.
In the church, we shared prayers and songs with the congregation of nuns from the convent, most of them very elderly and some even unable to sit up straight in their choir seats. The two very young ones took the lead in singing and combined Spanish, English, French, and German in the celebration, playing the organ as well. I couldn't help but marvel at their energy and ability, and at what had moved them in their lives to wear the habits. Those girls, like the pilgrims, had also embarked on a spiritual path, but theirs did not allow for half measures; it was undoubtedly much more extreme. I pictured them as punk rockers of the twenty-first century, performing on stage in outfits and behaviors that were unusual for girls their age today. They had renounced their material possessions, and in the nakedness that could be glimpsed under their habits, they embraced an unconventional life, radically different from what prevails in today's society. As we sang in chorus with them, the sound of the music even seemed transgressive to me.

18. León - San Martín del Camino (24.6 km)
One thing the Benedictine convent in León had going for it: the door to the hostel didn't open until six, the same time reveille was sounded. The hospitalero in charge of our dormitory turned on the lights and began to walk among the bunk beds with Gregorian music playing on his phone. So, at least that morning, I didn't wake up prematurely due to the succession of early risers, and we all got up at the same time, like in a barracks.
"Where can we leave the backpacks for them to come pick them up?" Pascual asked the retired grumpy man at the target, who had a grudge against the pilgrims.
"Here we don't want to know anything about that, transport companies are here to make money, and all they do is bother us, and we are not here to make money, so we don't want anything to do with them," the man replied as if reciting a litany while continuing to walk up and down the corridors.
Toni said goodbye to all the acquaintances, including Pascual, to whom he gave a hug. At the shelter, we had a frugal breakfast as a donation and set off.
In the streets of León, the yellow arrows made you take a detour so that you passed in front of the cathedral. That morning, I didn't mind that they made our way out of the city a bit longer. It was Wednesday, and in the square in front of the illuminated cathedral, they were setting up the fruit and vegetable stalls of a market. Toni was talking to me about something, he was even more talkative than usual, so I couldn't stop to consider that somewhat medieval image of the Gothic next to a popular market. We kept moving forward, we passed in front of the basilica of San Isidoro and he kept on talking non-stop, and I tried to reconcile what he was telling me with what surrounded me, I would have liked to ask him to be quiet for a bit. We continued through the expansion of the city, crossing the streets without waiting for the pedestrian traffic lights to turn green, since the traffic was still light. At the end of an avenue, we arrived at a park and suddenly, on the sidewalk, we found that the yellow arrows drew a fork: left to Santiago, right to Oviedo. That was already San Marcos square, the place where we had to part ways, we had arrived earlier than expected. It caught me off guard and I think it caught him off guard too.
"Well, that's it," he said.
-Yes -I said, embarrassed.
So Toni took the initiative and approached me to give me a hug. I leaned to my left without thinking and he did the same on his side, so there was no collision.
"Neither heart to heart nor hostilities," he said as we parted ways.
We started walking immediately, each in our own direction.
"I wish you well," I said, raising my arm.
"You will arrive in Santiago without any problems, you're doing well, keep up your pace, don't be afraid," he shouted as he walked away.
I faced my path, but immediately, without stopping, I turned my gaze towards him. He walked as usual, holding the cane as if it were a spear, swinging it in time with his hurried steps. He was still there, within my sight, and I felt the vertigo of watching him leave, probably never to see him again. But I feared that he might also turn around and find me looking at him, so I straightened up and kept moving forward. "Buen Camino, companion," I muttered under my breath.
I advanced like a ghost through the avenues towards the outskirts of León. Groups of pilgrims passed me by without saying anything. After a while, I entered a café where there was no one and had my coffee with milk alone. Then I crossed a suburban area of semi-detached houses that were half-built, abandoned there due to the crisis, among fenced vacant lots with boarded-up doors and windows. At a certain moment, I looked up and encountered the warm colors of the sunrise, and then I felt some comfort.
From León to Astorga, the guide suggested an alternative route that was a bit longer but took you away from the national road that connects both cities. I dismissed the proposal and followed the original route, the direct one next to the road. I didn't mind the traffic inconvenience or the ugliness of the journey; I preferred to finish the stage as soon as possible.
At the entrance of San Martín del Camino, I passed by two private hostels where I saw pilgrims settling in. That's why, even though it was only twelve-thirty, when I arrived at the municipal hostel, I was surprised to find it so deserted. Sitting on the steps leading to the reception, a man with a cap, weather-beaten skin, and a neglected salt-and-pepper beard was smoking a cigarette. He mumbled a "good morning" in response to my greeting. He followed me inside and, as he walked to the other side of the table, I realized he was the hospitalero. In silence, he stamped my credential and recorded my information in the registration book.
-There's a community dinner -he told me in a rough and hoarse voice, showing a somewhat toothless mouth-. Grilled sardines. If you want to join, let me know.
He accompanied me to the bedroom. But first, in the hallway, we had to leave the slippers in the shoe rack, which was completely empty.
"Hasn't anyone else come?" I asked.
—No.
Oh, God, where had I gotten myself into? At that moment, I regretted my decision not to look up reviews about the hostels on the internet. Also, not having stayed in one of the private hostels I had passed by a moment earlier. Where were my people? Perhaps the ones I usually saw had taken the alternative route to Astorga. As I took off my shoes, I noticed backpacks with their unmistakable transport tags hanging at the end of the hallway. I felt relieved because that meant someone else would come, welcome were the pilgrims.
In the bedroom, the beds were numbered. I spread my sleeping bag on the one with the number one and smiled as I remembered Toni's departure in Hornillos: I had also managed to secure a pole position.
As I shaved, showered, put cream on my feet, washed and hung the clothes, more pilgrims started arriving, many of them familiar faces, so everything was back to normal. At one of the tables in the courtyard, I ate a tortilla sandwich I had bought on the way, along with a cold can of beer that the hospitalero had for sale. Then I felt tremendously tired. I went back to the room, lay down on my bunk bed, and fell asleep.
"Did you really not expect it to affect you?" my wife asked me when we talked on the phone that afternoon.
"No, the truth is that we're not," I replied. And, in the face of his silence, I added, "That's how things stand."
It was she who encouraged me to sign up for the community dinner that night; at first, I wasn't very keen. I was writing in my notebook at one of the tables in the courtyard, a space with grass and trees that seemed to have belonged to a kindergarten before. Around me, people were resting peacefully, having a drink, reading, or chatting quietly; it was nice there. I realized that I was the only Spanish person.
-You, set the table -the host ordered me unexpectedly. He had approached me to tell me, and by the time I looked up from my notebook, he was already walking away; the man seemed a bit stressed.
Perhaps he caught me off guard because he didn't speak English and I was the only one he could communicate with directly. I followed him to the corner where he was preparing the barbecue fire, so he could give me more details about what needed to be done, where things were, and so on.
Some people quickly approached me to help. An Italian offered to prepare the salad, and the truth is that he was good at it, it looked like a restaurant salad due to the arrangement and cutting of the ingredients. I asked him if he worked in the kitchen, but he didn't want to confess. We joined the two wooden tables with benches and placed plates, glasses, and cutlery (there were no two identical pieces). I uncorked the bottles of red wine that, although cheap, were abundant. And by the time the sixteen of us who had signed up for dinner sat down at the table, José, the host, said we should start with the salad, as the first batch of sardines would be ready soon.
A blonde New Yorker with thick-rimmed glasses sat down next to me, thrilled that I was Spanish because, she said, she had a bunch of questions to ask me. José came over from the grill for a moment to eat his salad, accompanied by a pitcher that was half beer and half wine, which he filled to the brim again before getting up once more.
- How do you eat this? - the American woman asked me when the first sardines were served, which looked as black as coal on the white plate. It was also true that it was getting dark and there wasn't much light.
He saw me grab a knife and fork, but José, who was looking increasingly cheerful and relaxed, asked us all to pay attention for a moment, as he was going to give us a demonstration:
—In Spain, sardines are eaten like this— and using his hands, he ripped the head off the one on the plate and then grabbed it by the tail, lifting it above his head before swallowing it whole as if he were eating a Catalan calçot.
We all applauded. But the American woman sitting next to me wasn't convinced, among other things because she saw that I wasn't following the hospitalero's method.
—But do you eat the bones? And the skin? —she asked me, not daring to try the ones waiting for her on her plate.
All in all, the sardines were good. And for dessert, she served us portions of watermelon and yogurts ("yogurt for dessert? We have it for breakfast," the American continued, still amazed).
In the brief after-dinner conversation that followed, I had the opportunity to ask José where he was from. His eyes were shining. He said he was from Madrid.
—And how come you're around here, boss?
—Well, I just came to do the Camino and here I stayed.
—And how about being a hospitalero, are you comfortable?
-Oh, I'm doing really well here -he told me-. Look, before coming here I was in a really bad place, almost kicking the bucket. But here it's good, isn't it?
I nodded in agreement. It had gotten late by Camino standards, so it was time to start cleaning up. There was no need for someone to give orders, no need to look for volunteers, we all did something. I think we all realized that, in its own way, that dinner had been memorable. When we finished picking everything up, I went back out to the courtyard to see how the night was before going to bed. Sitting on the steps was José, smoking, just as I had seen him at noon when I arrived at the hostel. I took a deep breath. It was nice there, indeed.



At the municipal hostel in San Martín del Camino, José, the hospitalero, caught me off guard and said, "You, set the table." At your command, boss. And this is how it turned out, with the help of the other pilgrims who signed up for dinner. The dinners are very modest, but wine is always present, even if it's a cheap red from Valdepeñas.
19. San Martín del Camino - Astorga (23.7 km)
In the morning, in the dining room of the San Martín del Camino hostel, breakfast was ready. On the table there was bread, butter, jam, milk, and freshly made coffee, and the cups turned upside down on the saucers invited you to sit down. My plan was to have breakfast on the go, but I decided to stay when I saw the care with which José had prepared everything. He looked like he had just woken up, but he didn't stop moving, replenishing what ran out. As I had breakfast, I thought about him, his limitations, and the difficulties that could be guessed, and, observing the interest he showed, I was glad that he had found there, in that lost hostel, the opportunity to feel useful.
When I left, I thanked him. He made a vague gesture of assent and slipped away without looking at me. I went to where the donation box was to leave the contribution for dinner and breakfast, which supposedly was what José lived on (besides the sale of drinks), since the five euros for accommodation went to the town hall. There were no signs like "With what you contribute today, those who come tomorrow will eat," or "Donation is not free." He hadn't reminded us of this at any time. I left him considerably more than what I had left in any of the hostels I had visited until then.
Along the parallel road to the highway, I covered the first stretch of the stage even at night. From Hospital de Órbigo, there was an alternative path to Astorga, a bit longer but more beautiful. Today, I decided to take it. The guidebook mentioned that here one leaves behind the plains of the plateau to cross slightly hilly terrain.
In Villares de Órbigo, I passed by a house where they had left a chair in the middle of the street, using its backrest as support for the following note written on a piece of paper: "W.C. (Services). Water. No Donations", with the "No" underlined. At the end of the hallway, you could indeed see the bathroom of a private house with its toilet and sink. And no one around, there didn't seem to be a catch.
In this same town, a little further ahead, against the wall of another house, they had left a box of plums and a little sign on top that said: "For the pilgrim. Take one. Best regards." How nice, I thought, taking one.
In Santibáñez de Valdeiglesias, I was lost in thought as I passed by the bar of a hostel, whose terrace was full of pilgrims. I was walking behind someone who was probably American despite their Asian features. Coming towards me was a lady in a dressing gown and slippers, with a loaf of bread under her arm.
"But where are you going?! It's that way!" the lady shouted at the person in front of me, pointing to the previous street where, indeed, the yellow arrows clearly indicated turning, a street that both of us had missed, he out of distraction and me for following him.
We turned halfway at the same time, like a spring, causing laughter from those on the terrace watching us.
The path turned into a dirt and stone track as it ascended towards an area of low scrubland, with small holm oaks and oaks. The heat was intense. Reaching the beach bar that a hippie had set up in the middle of nowhere felt like stumbling upon an oasis. There were hammocks hanging between the trees, trays of fruit arranged on sections of tree trunks serving as tables and seats, and a kiosk with drinks bearing the motto: "The key to essence is presence," placed among hearts and a sun. A pilgrim played the guitar singing "Wish you were here" by Pink Floyd, while another accompanied her on the harmonica.
Nearby, there was a high point from which Astorga could be seen, with its two cathedral towers standing out. As always in these cases, there were still several kilometers to go that inevitably felt extremely long to me. As I was approaching the city on paths surrounded by cornfields, Mahmud, the British gentleman, dark-haired and in great physical shape, who had been my bunk neighbor in Burgos, overtook me. He was already a familiar presence to me because I had later crossed paths with him in some other hostel and several times on the way. Even so, I was once again impressed by his strides when he passed me near Astorga. No walking stick or hat to protect himself from the sun, he didn't even seem to be carrying water. It was as if he had gone out for a walk on any given Sunday in the English countryside. He had a standard-sized backpack whose weight he seemed oblivious to. If he saw something in the surroundings that caught his attention, he would stop, deviate to observe it better, ask anyone who could clarify his doubts, and then resume the route, overtaking you again with his light-footed schoolboy walk with a backpack.
That day, as soon as Mahmud overtook me, I got annoyed (he was only missing whistling) and decided to follow him. He seemed happier than a lark passing everyone. I managed to keep up with him, although barely. We were leaving behind pilgrims at an insulting speed who seemed to be suffering in penance, moving forward with short steps aided by two walking sticks. In the end, I realized I was being foolish and slowed down, letting him go ahead. When this man arrived at the hostel, he would take off his shoes, take out the thick novel he was reading from his backpack, and lie down to read it on the bunk bed, while around him the rest of the people carried out their daily routines of showering, laundry, creams, treatments, meals, and so on. But Mahmud didn't even seem to be sweating. When he finished reading and took a short nap, then he would shower and get ready for dinner. Truly, he was a vacationer hiker.
In Astorga, I stayed at the public hostel of the Servants of Mary, which was one of the large ones due to its capacity for more than a hundred and fifty pilgrims. The cells of the old convent were now small rooms where only four bunk beds fit. When I returned from the shower, I found a Brazilian woman downstairs who was exhausted. I had overtaken her shortly before arriving at the hostel when I was chasing Mahmud at full speed. She told me she was from Brasilia, and not much more, because she spent the day in her sleeping bag with her cell phone. The other two spots were taken by two French people, a man and a young woman named Geraldine, whom I would meet again at the hostel in the next stage.
I headed to the center of Astorga, which was very close by, with the intention of having a set menu. I was very hungry and that blinded me: I fell into the temptation of trying the "cocido maragato". Even though I knew it was a mistake: ten types of meat plus chickpeas, vegetables, soup, and custard. And in this order, because the peculiarity of the "cocido maragato" was that it was eaten backwards: first the meat and at the end the soup, so that everything would fit in («and if there's anything left, let it be the soup»). But I fell for it because the Casa Maragata restaurant was the first thing I came across and it was specialized in serving only this typical stew.
I did what I could, even though the waiter was encouraging me. Although I overate, I couldn't finish it all. When I left the restaurant, I took a walk around Astorga to see the cathedral and Gaudí's episcopal palace from the outside. Then, as if I hadn't walked enough that morning, I continued walking through the city streets to see if it would help with digestion and make things settle. Something (the chorizo among other things) was repeating on me, and I couldn't stop burping. A little later, when I thought I had made some room in my stomach, I went into a bar to have a chamomile tea.
When I went out, I ran into Pascual and Amparo on the street, who were taking a walk.
"Don't imagine the amazing stew we've eaten," Pascual informed me excitedly. "We went to a place they told us is where they prepare it the best."
—Yes, I have also eaten Maragato stew.
—First the meats: bacon, ear, snout, trotter, chorizo, a bit of everything, up to ten; and then the chickpeas, the cabbage, the potatoes, and finally a thick noodle soup, and then homemade custard with a sponge cake from here, you won't believe it...
—Yes, yes, me too...
—...how full we've gotten, really stuffed, and also cheap, because then later at night just by drinking water you have dinner sorted out.
—"How much did it cost you?" I asked.
I was going to catch it here.
—Right now I don't remember exactly, who paid for this, how much did it cost us, Amparo? And how much was yours?
Wow man, so you did hear me when I told you that I did too. I should have replied that I didn't remember "exactly" either. But I lack the nerve for these things and, foolishly, since Amparo wasn't saying anything, to avoid being rude I said that mine had been twenty-three euros.
—Oh, yes, now you have reminded me, ours was twenty-two.
—Coffee included?
-We don't drink coffee, as it keeps us up all night.
Okay then, you win, I thought. Next, we discussed something about the stage for the following day and said goodbye, wishing each other a good digestion.
Back at the hostel, I bought a liter and a half bottle of water. I started to feel a stinging sensation on one of my toes due to a small scrape. Here is one more reason to worry. Although this one was well deserved, for messing around with clever gentlemen.
In the room, the woman from Brasilia was still wrapped up in her sleeping bag, typing on her phone. The space was too small, so I decided to leave with my notebook and prepare the photos and texts for the blog. I could have gone to the common areas of the hostel, but instead, I headed back to the street, to an adjacent park. There, on a bench, no one would bother me. But amidst the stomach heaviness, tiredness, and loneliness, I felt down. It was curious: I avoided people, especially in large hostels like the one in Astorga; but then, and more than ever after such a pleasant experience like the communal dinner the night before in San Martín del Camino, I missed them and felt lonely.
It was getting dark by the time I finished my homework. I went back to the room and found it with the light off. It was only nine o'clock, but the French girl wanted to sleep. The Brazilian girl looked like a ghost with her face illuminated by her phone. I climbed up the bunk bed ladder, lay down, and prepared to fall asleep.



One of those hippy-new-age beach bars that appear out of nowhere. Good vibes reign in them: hammocks, logs to sit on, fruit, juices, coffee, and cookies, all by donation. When I arrived at this one, there was a girl playing the guitar and another one playing the harmonica.



Arriving in Astorga, Mahmud overtakes me, walking very agile and fast. In the photo, you can appreciate his stride compared to the pace of the pilgrim on the left. I got competitive and followed him for a stretch, until I couldn't keep up with his pace.
           20. Astorga — Foncebadón (25.8 km)
I woke up at six, went to the bathroom, got ready, and left the Astorga hostel. I entered a nearby bar that offered breakfast. Miraculously, I had already digested the stew from the previous day, and a great emptiness had taken its place. The bar had the TV on with the news from Canal 24 Horas. While eating my toast, I watched the screen with bewilderment, as I had not heard about the resignation of a minister or why they were demanding the dismissal of another. I was completely disconnected from current events, as if I were traveling in a foreign country.
When I set off, I didn't feel the discomfort of the chafing that had appeared the day before due to the absurd race after Mahmud. So I found myself walking comfortably and in good spirits. Although every now and then something Pascual had told me the day before would come to mind: apparently, the parish hostel in Foncebadón only had eighteen spots available, and it would be necessary to "be on the ball" to avoid being left out. I knew that, worst-case scenario, there would be private hostels available, but even so, I was in the same situation as always, and the fear of being excluded lingered in my mind.
At this stage, the Castilian plateau was definitively left behind. Through the region of Maragatería, one climbed up to the mountains of León with a gentle but steady slope. I walked without stopping until El Ganso, a village where I came across a bar called Cowboy. Toni hadn't mentioned this place to me, but it looked like one of those curious taverns along the Camino, like Elvis. It stood out because Cowboy also had its entire facade painted to advertise the bar. The establishment occupied a small warehouse that must have once been a garage to store the tractor and farming tools. Inside, it seemed like a flea market due to the amount of old objects hanging behind the bar, a mishmash that I eventually managed to make sense of: it seemed to be a collection of things related to the Wild West, among which cowboy hats stood out, although there were also hats of other kinds, all set in a typical Spanish bar scene with Spanish flags in the background.
- Can I have a coffee with milk, please?
"And without a favor," a man in his sixties with gray mustache and gold metal frame glasses replied from the other side of the bar.
—"How's everything going, lots of people?" I asked, hoping he would tell me something.
—Don't you dare address me as "usted", damn it!
I was served a black coffee with milk, no foam, very strong.
—No, not many people are around. And in the afternoons, nobody —he finally said, softening it a bit. Maybe he wasn't having a good day. I noticed a certain resemblance to the former football coach Luis Aragonés.
Ramiro, as he was called, opened the Cowboy bar in 1991, and told me that he didn't understand all this about people walking around in the early hours and not a soul passing by in the afternoon.
—Look, I don't know if it's because of the heat or because of the Chinese, but this didn't happen before.
I stayed for a while longer, observing Ramiro's somewhat brusque manners with some Americans who had just entered and to whom he was shouting to make himself understood in Spanish. The coffee he had served me was strong, and it was hard for me to finish it. But I wouldn't have dared to leave without drinking it all.
After El Ganso, the landscape became more rugged. There were stretches where the trail passed through forests of young oaks separated from the path by a metal fence, on whose mesh they had inserted hundreds of crosses made with two branches or crossed sticks. I thought that someone must have come up with the first one and the pilgrims who had come behind must have imitated the work. Although on second thought, it could also have emerged as a spontaneous tribute to the American pilgrim who was murdered near here by a disturbed local. It happened three years earlier: the woman, forty years old, veered off the path and then followed some arrows that the killer had diverted so that someone would pass through his property. It was her turn. I remembered what I had told myself at the beginning of the journey, about always trusting the Camino's signage. That woman had also set off confidently from Astorga that morning, but she never completed the stage.
In Rabanal del Camino, I had some fried eggs with bacon and potatoes and a beer for lunch. I had been wanting to do this for several days. Besides, since I had separated from Toni, I had decided to follow a new meal policy: no more carrying it in my backpack. Not even water, in order to travel lighter. If I got thirsty? I would drink when I arrived at a place where I could do so. I was on the Camino Francés and there was a village every so often. I mentioned it to my wife in a message where I included the photo of the plate with the eggs, to make her envious. She replied that not carrying water seemed fine to her, although "risky".
—Why "risky"?
—Well, because I don't see you asking for water at a bar, and muscles don't get hydrated with beer.
—What do you mean no? I have asked for water many times.
—Yes, for me.
I was right. That's why, when I got up from the table ready to tackle the ascent to Foncebadón, I was tempted to buy a small bottle of water at a store. But at that moment, I wasn't thirsty and, in the end, I decided not to buy it so I wouldn't have to carry it.
I arrived without any problems to Foncebadón, a mountain village located at one thousand four hundred meters above sea level, which was abandoned until the resurgence of the Camino in the nineties brought it back to life. I walked along its only street (the Camino itself), which was still unpaved despite the cars accessing it to reach the hostels, bars, and restaurants on both sides. It gave me the impression of being in a winter resort with a wild touch, as if the place had not been completely tamed.
Up, at the end of the street, there was the church that had been rehabilitated as a shelter by an American Jacobean organization. In front of the closed door, sitting on a bench, Pascual and Amparo were waiting, bored, along with Isidro, a man from Murcia whom I was about to meet. No one else. So much fuss for this. While we waited for it to open, a Belgian woman and her daughter joined us, and later two Canadian girls.
At two o'clock, the door opened and a man and a woman appeared, both blond and around sixty years old. In slow, basic English, the man spoke for both of them, smiling all the time. They were from California and were volunteer hosts for the American Pilgrims On The Camino association.
"Who has understood what I just said?" asked Patrick, which was the man's name.
The foreign women raised their hands and I did too, timidly. I felt like a child in a classroom. I had to act as an interpreter for the Spaniards. Before letting us in, Patrick gave us absolutely all the instructions for using the hostel, one by one, many of them unnecessary due to their triviality. Between that and my translations, he kept us there for at least a quarter of an hour, and the customary "Remember, with the donation you leave today, those who come tomorrow will have dinner" was not missing. We were getting impatient. Isidro, the man from Murcia, ended up exploding:
—So much English, so much English, for heaven's sake.., we are in Spain, aren't we?
I noticed with surprise that he was addressing me, raising his voice a lot, as if I were the one who had irritated him. He added that he was tired and all he wanted was to take a shower, eat something, and lie down in the bunk.
- What? What is he saying? - Patrick asked me.
—No, no, nothing, he wants to know something that I will explain to him as soon as you finish —I replied.
I cursed that Murcian guy, a rustic man, also in his sixties, for putting me in a tight spot in front of the teacher and the others. To top it off, he was speaking loudly, although in his case he was doing it because he was partially deaf, something that I didn't know at that moment. His opposite was a Californian with the refined manners of a congregation pastor, lecturing us with his smile standing there in front of us, as we patiently waited for him to finish. The truth is that he was also getting on my nerves.
As they asked for collaboration for the community dinner, after shaving, showering, putting cream on my feet, washing and hanging the clothes, I offered to chop vegetables and thus free myself from other tasks later. At the dining table, I coincided with the two Canadian girls. I took care of the potatoes and they took care of the carrots and onions. They were two cheerful girls who laughed at how slowly they were going. They were not exactly in shape, and apparently, no one in their families believed they would be able to complete the Camino until the end. The first stage through the Pyrenees, from Sant-Jean to Roncesvalles, had almost killed them, and then, between the multiple breaks and their turtle pace, they accumulated a lot of delay.
—In Logroño we took a bus that dropped us off directly in Astorga, but don't tell anyone about this.
The hostel, meanwhile, was filling up. When I finished with the potatoes, I went out and walked down the uneven, stony street. I spent the afternoon in one of the bars, reading, writing, and having a few beers. By the time I returned to the hostel, I felt confident enough to continue acting as an interpreter during the communal dinner and the subsequent "moment of reflection," which was how Patrick had referred to the meeting that was going to take place later in the church chapel.
Dinner consisted of a salad and a bean stew with vegetables and bits of chorizo. For dessert, melon. I felt like the protagonist because of my role as a translator, so I decided to start conversations with those sitting around me at the table, including the Belgian woman and her daughter. After finishing dinner, Pascual and Isidro loudly said (but Patrick couldn't understand them because I didn't translate this part) that they were still hungry. They went to their room, opened their backpacks to complete their dinner with what they had brought, and skipped the communal gathering.
The bedroom occupied the nave of what used to be the church, but through a partition, they had preserved a separate area for use as a chapel. Patrick climbed onto the platform that served as the altar, and the rest of us sat on the two long benches in front. He said that he wasn't even Catholic, but Methodist, but that it didn't matter on the spiritual path we were all participating in there. He seemed in his element speaking in public, he had experience. He explained the tradition associated with the Iron Cross, through which we would pass early the next morning. And then he shared a personal anecdote in the form of a parable for us to reflect on.
He said that it was the second year that his wife, Sandy, and he had volunteered in Foncebadón, but the first time had been in a hostel in Grañón, also managed by the same American association. According to him, that was an experience similar to walking the Camino, due to the uncertainty about how they would perform as hospitaleros, who would show up at the door, those things. Towards the end of their stay there, a boy appeared who had been walking from his home in Germany. Chatting with him at dinner, the boy told them that his father had given him these three pieces of advice before he left: first, to take care of his own affairs and not worry about those he left behind, who would be fine; second, not to go faster than his soul could go; and third, to take care of his body.
Two days later, Patrick and his wife finished their shift in Grañón and decided to continue the Camino to Santiago on their own. It was a coincidence that they ran into the boy again, this time in the middle of Obradoiro Square. And, furthermore, he was accompanied by his father, who had flown to Santiago to meet his son at the end of his pilgrimage. Patrick suggested they have dinner together that night; he wanted to meet this wise man to get more insights about life. When they met again and he asked about it, the man replied that he had nothing more to say, that what he had told his son was all there was.
We fell silent. Patrick was already lighting the inevitable candle that we were going to have to pass to each other so that, when the turn came, each one would share a few words, whatever came to mind. People said very nice things, one of the Canadians recited a poem she had composed herself. When it was my turn, I did the same pantomime as in Bercianos: I took the candle with both hands and held it for a second as if reverencing the moment, so as not to have to open my mouth in return. The last one to hold the flame was a guy I hadn't noticed until then.
"I never thought I would find myself in a situation like this," she said hurriedly, immediately letting go of the baton as if it were burning her, causing everyone to laugh at her spontaneity and relieving the burden of solemnity in the event.



Cowboy Bar, pure western. The detail of the backpack parked outside can be appreciated in the photo, as if it were a steed that cannot enter the saloon. It's a custom of the Camino, one of those things that one sees and imitates. At the Cowboy, I ordered a latte, but Ramiro served me a strong Americano, no frills.



For a good stretch, hundreds of crosses formed between the wires of the fence, in memory, perhaps, of the American pilgrim murdered near here three years earlier by a local who had diverted the arrows so she would get lost. One of the foundations of the Camino is to follow the yellow arrows, to let oneself be guided by them. And look.



In Foncebadón, the unpaved street gives the feeling of a wild, untamed village. Cruz de Ferro is close by, and that's why it's experiencing a resurgence, as the village was once abandoned. Here, there are only pilgrims and services for them, which is why in places like this, one can appreciate very well the microcosm that forms around this floating country called the Camino de Santiago.



Sandy, the Californian volunteer hospitalera in Foncebadón, takes my information in the registration book after stamping my credential. Everything is very basic in these public hostels. The registration book itself seems to be from another time. To her right, the donation box to leave the contribution with which they will buy dinner for the pilgrims who come tomorrow.
21. Foncebadón - Ponferrada (26.8 km)
I had a rough night in Foncebadón. In the cramped shared bedroom of the hostel, they had crammed in too many bunk beds, and the feeling of suffocation due to the overcrowding was compounded by the fact that the bed frames were made of wood and made a lot of noise with the slightest movement. Amidst the cacophony of creaks, someone started snoring. I deduced it must be Isidro, as the sounds seemed to come from where I had seen him settle. I feared I would start snoring too as soon as I fell asleep. To make matters worse, the beans from dinner had given me gas and I was uncomfortable. Although, judging by the creaking of the bunk beds, I wasn't the only one who couldn't sleep; it felt like we were sailing aboard a galleon.
But somehow we saved the night because in the end, I don't know how, I fell asleep. In the morning I would have left straight away, but it was necessary to have breakfast because the stage was in the mountains. In the dining room, Geraldine sat in front of me, the French girl I had met at the hostel in Astorga.
"How did you sleep?" she asked me with a smile.
—Not very well —I replied—. Too much noise in the bunk beds.
She had a theory about what had happened and seemed eager to share it with me, to see what I thought: she said that the noise we each made when moving in bed generated a fear of disturbing each other and such tension that it did not allow us to fully relax and fall asleep; so in the end, the anxiety of not being able to rest made us toss and turn more, causing even more creaking.
—Come on, it would have been better if we had stopped worrying about making noise so we could fall asleep, reducing the noise and promoting everyone's sleep.
I couldn't agree more. A shared bedroom worked like a machine made up of complex pieces that influenced each other, resulting in the good or bad functioning of the whole. Now, how did one go about relaxing whenever they felt like it? I asked Geraldine. She told me that she had learned a lot about it on this trip, having set off on foot directly from her home in Poitiers.
- And how is the Camino through France? Is it signposted? Are there hostels?
—No, he's not very well-prepared. And since I don't have much money, what I used to do was sleep outdoors, in parks, in the countryside.
"Did you go camping?" I asked, amazed that a young girl like her would dare.
—Yes, whenever I could.
—And weren't you scared?
He told me yes, a lot. But it was worth it because you also learned a lot, among other things, how to relax. I didn't know whether to believe her. Although that night at the hostel, Geraldine just had time to realize the tension in the air before falling peacefully asleep.
I set off at such an hour that by the time I reached the summit, just two kilometers away, it was already dawn. As I got closer, I could see from a distance that the unremarkable mound I was approaching was none other than the famous Iron Cross, and I was greatly disappointed. It looked more like a small dump by the side of a road where cars passed by. It didn't match what I had imagined from the images I had seen. Indeed, it was a matter of perspective, because I myself took a photo from below showing only the top of the small hill, and within the image, I captured some pilgrims with their backpacks and walking sticks, looking like climbers reaching the summit of a steep mountain peak. How true it is that one must go to places themselves to see how they truly are.
I walked a few meters to a hermitage that was there and sat on a step to observe. People were waiting their turn to be photographed next to the post with the cross. The truth is that I didn't see anyone carry out the typical ritual of throwing a stone brought from home onto the pile, symbolizing the intention to rid oneself of a heavy burden in life. Perhaps I just didn't witness any enactment and it was done discreetly. Anyway, it was a place that evoked emotions; I saw a woman crying on another woman's shoulder. I noticed a girl who opened her backpack and scattered her things around, looking for something she apparently couldn't find. In the end, she started writing in her notebook, tore out the page, and left it folded under some rocks on the mound. She stood still for a few moments, very quiet, and then left.
I continued as well because I was expecting a tough stage. Along mountain paths, I soon arrived at the Manjarín refuge, another one of those famous places on the Camino. In an abandoned village of shepherds, Tomás, commander of the Order of the Temple, opened a hostel for pilgrims in the nineties. "It's not just that they didn't have electricity, they also didn't have running water," Toni had told me. Not even he had dared to spend the night here.
Amidst a jumbled accumulation of distance signs and worn multicolored flags, access was granted to a cabin that seemed on the verge of collapsing. Just as I entered, I crossed paths with Tomás, who was taking a dog for a walk. He was wearing a kind of white tunic with the red Templar cross on the chest, but on his head he had a cap instead of a medieval chainmail hauberk as I had seen on the internet. Given that it is an institution, I felt very fortunate to have seen him in person.
Inside, Gregorian music was playing. The disorder and dirt were even greater than one could imagine from the outside. There wasn't a single empty space on the walls; everything was filled with badges, photos, and posters. There was also costume jewelry with Templar symbolism for sale by a man who, regularly, rang a small bell like the ones used to call monks in a convent, but in this case, it was to attract pilgrims. They had coffee in thermoses, in exchange for a donation, but I didn't see any clean cups. A pilgrim who was having some asked the man selling jewelry if they had restrooms, and he replied that, as for "restrooms," no, but if she needed to go, there was a small hut across the road labeled "Outhouses." I waited a bit, looking around, and when the pilgrim returned, then it was my turn. And indeed, it was like stepping back in time: a small shack made of boards among the bushes, with a wooden floor inside with a hole in the middle and a lid. On top of it, they had written with a marker that once used, it should be closed, thank you, just like a toilet lid.
From Manjarín, we continued along mountain paths. At a certain moment, the hollow of the Bierzo region and the city of Ponferrada appeared far below and still very far away. With this visual reference, I realized that we were at a high altitude; it seemed like I could touch the sky with my hand. Here began a steep descent of about twelve kilometers that forced you to keep your eyes on the ground to avoid stumbling over the rocks. It was very tough; carrying the backpack made it inevitable to strain the knees and legs.
Halfway down, in El Acebo, I had a portion of empanada with a beer. This little village was the opposite of Foncebadón, its magnificent views over El Bierzo and the mountains had turned it into a tourist spot with pedestrian streets, souvenir shops, and balconies adorned with flowers.
I kept descending until Molinaseca, where the slope ended, but there were still eight kilometers to Ponferrada. It was very hot. I wish I had gone into a restaurant where it was cool, to replenish my strength with a menu, calmly, drinking a lot of water. Instead, I kept going strong wanting to finish and secure a spot in the hostel, as usual. And besides, I joined a girl who had spent the night at the Foncebadón hostel. At that moment, she was coming out of a pharmacy putting cream on her arms, which were sunburned from the mountain sun. She had light blonde hair and very fair skin, she looked Scandinavian.
—Hello —I greeted.
"Hello, how are you?" she replied.
It caught me off guard, I didn't think she was Spanish.
—Yes, I am from Madrid, although my parents are Dutch.
Her name was Andrea and she was walking fast, but I kept up with her pace. She told me she had just finished her degree, she was a computer engineer, and that she had come to do the Camino de Santiago to reflect on the future options she had ahead of her.
—And well, since I had twelve days available, what did I do? I looked at the stages and saw that I had enough time to do it from Astorga.
Just after deciding, she went to the nearest Decathlon to her house to get the basics, and in the afternoon she took a bus that dropped her off in Astorga, and the next day she was already on the Camino.
—But I even forgot the sunscreen, and look, I got a lot of sunburn, like a tourist —she laughed.
Actually, it was me who was burning up, because in the end I couldn't keep up with her, she left me behind, she was going too fast for me, fresh as a lettuce (but for her it was only her second stage!).
I got my revenge on a Japanese man whom I surpassed in the final stretch. That man was a strange character, he seemed quite old, almost like an elder, and he had a long Eastern sage beard. And yet, on the descent of the mountain, with his little backpack and two poles, he had passed me running. When I saw him, I couldn't believe it, I wondered how he didn't break his neck, he must have been extremely focused. In terms of strength, however, he wouldn't be doing great, because his running style was sloppy and now, at the gates of Ponferrada, it was me who was leaving him behind. I saw him on a corner of the road, with his hands on his knees and his head forward, as if he was about to vomit. He was a wreck. At least I would make it, I told myself as I passed by his side.
The hostel in Ponferrada was one of the big ones and, based on my experience of the last few days, that meant I wasn't going to socialize much. Better, because I didn't feel like being around people. Or worse, because it was those same people who could lift my spirits. In any case, I was exhausted and, after shaving, showering, putting cream on my feet, washing my clothes, and hanging them out to dry, I took a nap. And then it seemed to me that, since I was there, I should visit Ponferrada, its Templar Castle, and the historic center. But it was quite lamentable because I was dragging myself around due to how fatigued I still was. I cared very little about all that. Although wandering the streets, I had the opportunity to witness an amusing scene.
At first, they seemed like "perroflautas" to me, two bearded men standing on a pedestrian street, behind a dog dozing and a plate for coins. But they neither played the flute nor were beggars. On a sheet serving as a sign, they indicated that they lived on the Camino and offered to stamp the credential, implying in exchange for a donation. And indeed, they had pilgrim staffs and backpacks from which the scallop shell hung.
I passed by, but at least I had the reflex to turn around and, discreetly, take a picture of them. Later, I regretted not having approached them. What stamp would they have? Why didn't I get closer to give them some change? I could have asked them what they were doing, what "living on the Camino" meant in their case. I would have posted it on the blog. My passivity or absentmindedness may have been due to lacking the necessary mental energy. I had lost it along with the physical one during the long walk that day.
That night at the hostel, I said goodbye to Pascual and Amparo. They had been walking the Camino in stages, twelve days ago they had resumed it in Burgos and now they were interrupting it here, in Ponferrada, they were already tired.
—Actually, it's because of Amparo.
"Yes, this time it's enough since we're not young anymore," she said, who almost never spoke and when she did, it was to cover for her husband.
The tough stage of that day had also taken its toll on them. Perhaps they would return in the spring, it would be to finish in Santiago starting from here.
Pascual started explaining to me in detail the combination of different means of transportation they would take to return to their home in Valencia, a true work of organizational art. I listened to him for a bit, but I had to interrupt him because my head couldn't take it anymore. I told them I was going to bed, hoping to rest and be able to get up the next day.
"Well, then we say goodbye now," said Pascual.
And he threw himself at me to give me a strong hug. And then Amparo. Next, I quickly retreated to my bunk, before my pregnancy was noticed. It caught me off guard. I never would have thought I would miss them.



Cruz de Ferro. I haven't seen anyone fulfilling the ritual of throwing a stone, brought from home, symbolizing getting rid of a heavy burden in your life. The priority was rather to take a photo, for which you had to wait your turn. But I have seen people cry and the place can be moving.



Cruz de Ferro. Seen like this, it looks like the peak of Aizkorri massif. And yet, it's the same little mountain stuck on a pole from the other photo. A matter of framing. This was what I was expecting to find, maybe because it's what others had shown me. Even if it disappoints, how good it is to go oneself and check the overall view.



Refugio de Manjarín. There is no running water. The hospitalero is Tomás, also known for being a commander of the Order of the Temple. Gregorian music plays and occasionally a convent bell rings to attract the pilgrim, as they sell Templar jewelry.



Descent towards Ponferrada, which is the urban center you see in the background, down there. This downhill has killed me. It's many kilometers downhill and the legs have to withstand a lot of pressure. But it's a very powerful feeling to have the sky so close.



They are not hippies, although they may seem so at first glance. They are people who live on the Camino. They offer a stamp in exchange for a donation. I can only speculate about them because I have not approached them to give them a coin and ask them. And now I regret not having done so.

22. Ponferrada - Villafranca del Bierzo (24.2 km)
In the early hours, following the arrows to leave the city, I crossed a passageway under a block of houses where there was a graffiti on the wall that read "Compostilla," with the two "o's" replaced by scallop shells. It made me laugh, what silly humor, I thought, trying to find the connection that could exist between a postilla and Compostela. Further on, I came across the same word again, this time on a traffic sign. I took out my phone to look it up on Google and then I understood that "Compostilla" was the name of the neighborhood I had crossed.
I continued along a local road, leaving behind the last houses of Ponferrada and with them the public lighting. As it was getting light, I didn't need to turn on the flashlight that I had tied to my head, it was already visible. Shortly after, I reached a fork in the road where a Camino sign was missing, like the ones that had guided me so far. I stopped looking for another indication and then I heard a noise of branches very close by, among the undergrowth that bordered the narrow road. It must have been some bird. But suddenly, something jumped onto the road, an undefined animal the size of a very thick and dark dog. It stood looking at me about five meters away, its eyes shining. At that moment, time stood still, I was paralyzed with my senses on high alert and my mind searching for a way out. I didn't feel any pilgrim coming from behind, but I had my walking stick to defend myself. On an unconscious impulse, I turned on the headlamp and saw it: a wild boar! It ran up the road (at great speed, its hooves echoing on the asphalt) until it disappeared again into the undergrowth.
Scared, but also delighted by the beauty of this encounter with the wild and unpredictable, I waited just a minute for several pilgrims to catch up before continuing the march behind them. I soon arrived at a town called Columbrianos and went into the first bar, one called Bar Pedrín. Upon entering, the waitress behind the bar squinted her eyes and shielded them with her hand, asking me to please turn off the flashlight. I hadn't even realized I still had it on. "Oops," I thought to myself moments later, while having a cup of coffee with milk, unable (nor wanting) to shake off what had just happened out there.
From Ponferrada to Villafranca, the stage passed through the region of El Bierzo, a large basin surrounded by mountains. At first, the valley was green and fairly flat, and then hills covered with vineyards appeared. The landscape was Mediterranean, in line with the microclimate enjoyed in El Bierzo, although the roofs of the houses still remained slate, which reminded of the proximity of the mountains.
I started feeling pain when I stepped. A lot. I stopped at a corner and took off my shoes and socks. Indeed, there they were: the blisters; they had appeared like rashes on both feet, on the edges and also on the soles, under the toes, which were the ones making me see stars. The steep descent to Ponferrada, plus the final sprint in the scorching heat and my feet soaked in sweat, all of that had finally taken its toll on me. I remembered the barrage of advice about blisters that I received from Pascual in Mansilla de las Mulas, in the following days I was going to regret not listening to him. But when he gave them to me, I couldn't take seriously what this man was telling me, not after his exaggeration in Castrojeriz about my swollen foot, which turned out to be nothing in the end.
I sweated buckets to get to Villafranca del Bierzo, and once there, I thought about going as usual to the municipal hostel, which was the first one at the entrance of the town. But Toni had recommended the legendary Ave Fénix, a hostel with a long tradition on the Camino. I was undecided. I looked for some shade and took out my phone, ignoring my resolution not to look at user reviews on the internet. I found out that Ave Fénix had either very good or very bad reviews, depending on whether the atmosphere or the comfort was valued more, respectively.
I finally decided to live the experience. Also, that way I would say hello on behalf of Toni to a certain Juan who worked there. A fifty-something man with a prominent belly and gray mustache stamped my credential and took my information. He had a bandana with the Confederate flag tied pirate-style on his head. That man had a bit of Obelix in him, and since he seemed unique, I asked him if he happened to be Juan. No, he wasn't; Juan was around there, he would appear soon. And no, he wasn't Mr. Jato either, the famous owner of the hostel.
The bedroom I was assigned was attic-like and located above the dining room. There were a bunch of bunk beds stuck together. This was something that made me uncomfortable, having to sleep bed against bed with a stranger, but luckily I found one that was isolated. I spread my sleeping bag on it and, as I took things out of my backpack, suddenly, I found a little girl about two years old behind me, in diapers, staring at me. To my surprise, she turned around and, wobbling, went back to an adjacent room where her mother, sitting on a mattress on the floor, was watching us.
The hostel was a kind of reconstructed mansion that surrounded a central courtyard like an atrium. Inside, there was some neglected vegetation, and some people with a dog and a tent had camped right there, in a corner. There were tables and chairs with advertising on the terrace. It was necessary to go out to this courtyard to access some services that seemed like those of a barracks: one of the compartments had a hole in the floor instead of a toilet, and there were no doors; instead, the booths were protected by simple shower curtains.
My foot hurt just by putting it on the ground, so after shaving, showering, applying cream, washing and hanging the clothes, I decided I wouldn't drag myself around Villafranca del Bierzo to do some painful sightseeing. In a bar around the corner, I had a tortilla sandwich and a beer, and then I went back to the hostel to pop my blisters and rest lying in bed.
In the afternoon, I went out to the patio with my notebook and then the one with the Confederate bandana who looked like Obelix approached me to say, "Look, there's Juan." He was a guy sitting on the terrace with a beer can and smoking a hand-rolled cigarette. Maybe he was my age, although he looked more worn out, with messy hair and beard and weather-beaten skin. Despite the heat, he was wearing a thick green army sweater. I approached him and gave him regards from Toni. "Oh, yes," he said, although he would later admit that it was impossible to remember everyone who passed by there. As soon as I mentioned where I was from, he invited me to sit with him and took out two new beer cans from the machine.
"I know Donosti very well," he told me. "I lived there for several years."
He told me that he had been a vagabond since he was old enough to leave his native Badajoz. Between one thing and another, he ended up in San Sebastián and settled with his dog at gate twenty-three of the Anoeta football stadium. Until the social services people enrolled him in a hospitality assistant course, from which he emerged with a job as a kitchen assistant in a well-known restaurant in the Old Town of San Sebastián.
—Shit, you have no idea how much they screwed me over at work, man, what a bunch of bastards.
From that point on, Juan began to explain to me the humiliations he was subjected to at that job. As he told me about it, he became increasingly agitated at times, I even got the impression that he was getting angry with me. "Those bastards really screwed me over," he repeated over and over again, taking nervous puffs of his cigarette and drinking from his beer can while recounting the grievances suffered, related to the disregard for his rights but above all the disdain for his person.
—Because I worked harder and better than anyone else. But they found out I came from the streets and then they screwed me over good. And even though I was subsidized and didn't cost them anything, sons of bitches.
He endured two years and ten months. He swore to me that he tried, but he had to leave. He couldn't even get fired to collect unemployment benefits.
—And then I came to the Camino.
He began to wander it like the vagabond he already was, staying here and there for a few days, a while.
—The only good thing about all that was that I got my food handler's card, and so, Jato, the boss here, rescued me for the Phoenix's kitchen. Do you want to check if what I've told you is true, that I know how to work well?
I told him that I didn't doubt it. But in any case, I was going to confirm it because I had signed up for the community dinner, for which Juan was going to prepare a Valencian paella for us. He got up and went to the kitchen to start working on it, as he said that making it properly took time.
A couple of hours later, in the dining room with long tables and benches at the Ave Fénix, about forty people squeezed in for dinner. Before starting with the salad, Jesús Jato, the boss, made us stand up and hold hands forming a chain. He simply said he was happy to have us there that night and that we arrived safely in Santiago. Then, he raised his intertwined hands and shouted:
—Ultreia!
To which we all responded by imitating him:
—ULTREIA!!
And next:
—Suseia!
—SUSEIA!!
(It seems that the greeting between pilgrims in the Middle Ages used to be this: "Ultreia" ["onward!"], one would say. "Et suseia" ["and beyond!"], the other would reply).
At the table, I found myself surrounded by Danish and German pilgrims delighted to be staying in such an authentic hostel, the first one that had been set up as such on the Camino de Santiago, according to their guides. I had also been reading in the afternoon on the internet about the figure of Jesús Jato, a man who as a child had seen his grandmother accommodate pilgrims in the stable of his house and who, now, at almost eighty years old, still believed in all this, despite the fact that, in his opinion, so many hostels offering comforts were killing the spirit of the Camino. Upon reading this, it occurred to me that, perhaps, the toilets with shower curtains were not due to neglect (or not only), but had some intention in line with the campaign spirit that prevailed in the hostel. In an interview in a newspaper, Jato was saying the following:
The Camino is like life. You start it and you have joys, pains, hardships, good times, bad times, everything. And you meet people. But there is something there that makes those encounters special, including the one you establish with yourself. That's why it's a completely different world.
Juan and Obelix, confederate, made their entrance into the dining room carrying between them the large paella pan. We all stood up applauding and taking photos as they tilted it to show it to us. Spectacular. And it was really good, an authentic Valencian paella done to perfection. When we finished dinner, I went to Juan to congratulate him. Until shortly before, all I knew about him was what he had told me, his words full of pain and anger towards those who had hurt him. But now I was going to congratulate him (to show him my respect) for daring to take on the responsibility of cooking (and doing it so well) for forty diners from all over the world. "Fantastic paella, Juan," I said. He thanked me. His eyes were moist, he seemed happy.
At night, the pilgrims retired to bed early, but in the dining room, which was right below the room, the hospitaleros and others continued chatting animatedly with their beers, among whom must have been the mother of the little girl I had seen before, as her daughter's voice could be heard from time to time. While waiting to fall asleep, I kept thinking about all that, about the Phoenix understood as a place of refuge. "I never thought that certain things would have to be priced," Jato said, referring to the spirit of the Camino, in the interview I had read in the afternoon.
From one of the bunk beds, a pilgrim pounded on the wooden floor of the room to ask for silence from those below. I thought I heard Juan laughing and coughing at the same time, while another from his group hissed asking them to lower their voices. It was the first time I found myself in a situation where it was the guests of an accommodation who were calling the shots on the staff. I smiled inside my sleeping bag. Indeed, that was priceless.



Spectacular paella at the community dinner of the Phoenix Hostel. If there is an authentic hostel on the Camino, that is the Phoenix Hostel. You have to go there. The reviews that customers leave about this hostel on the internet are usually very bad. Those of the pilgrims, very good.

23. Villafranca del Bierzo — La Faba (23.1 km)
It was cold in the morning, with a temperature in the single digits when I crossed the streets of Villafranca del Bierzo still in the dark. It was Monday, but so early that there was no one around except pilgrims. Past the town, I continued along the shoulder of a traffic-free road, next to the river in a closed valley, and I noticed how the humidity increased the feeling of cold. I remembered the raincoat I had left behind in Hornillos to travel lighter, telling myself that I would figure out what to do when I needed to bundle up.
Well, here's what I did that morning before leaving: I put on all the clothes I had with me. Double layer, both sweatpants and t-shirt. The walking outfit on top of the casual one. With that plus the jacket, and the backpack protecting my back, I wasn't doing too bad. Also, in a couple of bars, I warmed up my numb hands with the cup of coffee with milk.
The temperature kept rising during the morning and the cold stopped being a concern to make way for the pain of blisters and doubts about whether I would be able to finish the official stage in O Cebreiro, already in Galicia. The last stretch was "the biggest ascent of the French Way in Spanish territory," according to the guidebook, and faced with that, I didn't rule out shortening the journey by staying in La Faba, a village halfway up where there was a hostel run by Germans.
Towards Vega de Valcarce, a pilgrim caught up with me eager to talk. Around fifty years old, his name was Kepa and he was from Bilbao. He had a strong voice and a straightforward manner. When I told him I was Basque too, he was overjoyed (he didn't know how much I was going to disappoint him). He had just started the Camino the day before, in Ponferrada.
"My psychiatrist told me to do it," he added, fixing his gaze on me.
It struck me that he told me like that, out of the blue. It gave me the impression that he expected me to ask him about it, but I didn't. So he kept trying, giving me bits and pieces of his personal shipwreck, his divorce, the subsidy that wasn't enough to live on, his children whom he barely saw. I listened to him but didn't engage, not even nodded. And it's not that I didn't care, on the contrary, but that was too sudden, that's not how things are told. He kept talking to me about the group therapy colleagues he was seeing, who were cheering him up on WhatsApp. They jokingly asked him if he was already praying.
"They make fun of me because I'm the most anti-religious person you can come across," he told me. "But I'm not doing the Camino de Santiago for that reason, I've come for mental health reasons. And you?"
—Yes, yes, me too.
There the matter stood. I stood beneath a magnificent highway viaduct that rose high above our heads. I told him I was going to wait for a trailer to pass so that the photo I wanted to take of that bridge would look better, but Kepa also stopped to wait with me.
- Do you know if there will be any pharmacy in this town? I have run out of Orfidal and I need to buy some.
He stared at me again, as if waiting for something of mine to happen. It was clear he wasn't going to stop until he gained my complicity.
There was a pharmacy. When we arrived, I left him buying his anxiolytic and told him that I would keep going, and that if anything, we would see each other later.
Definitely, I was going to have to shorten the stage, because I wasn't doing well. Upon arriving in Las Herrerías, the village where the ascent to the mountain began, I stopped to have a beer. I knew it wasn't a good idea, as at that moment sitting down provided great relief, but later, when I got up, the blisters hurt twice as much. What could I do. While I was having the beer, through the bar's windows I saw Kepa pass by accompanied by another pilgrim. They were chatting as if they already knew each other, determined towards the end of the stage in O Cebreiro, and I thought it would be best for me to stay in La Faba, with the Germans.
Interestingly, as soon as the ascent began, I noticed that, since my worst blisters were under my toes due to weight distribution, going uphill wasn't as torturous for me as going downhill. That's why I arrived quite intact in La Faba. And as I entered the hostel grounds, on the porch I instantly recognized the figure of Mahmud, whom I hadn't seen since the time I tried to keep up with his pace in Astorga. He was unmistakable with his yellow cotton t-shirt and his summer shorts.
—Man!, you here? —I greeted him.
I was bored because I had been waiting for a while for the hostel to open.
—I have chosen to stay here because my guidebook says that this place is one of the most beautiful on the Camino. And it is, indeed.
I sat down next to him on the bench to wait as well. As an architect (from his appearance I would have said doctor), he explained something to me about the beautiful church in front of us. Mahmud was of Turkish Cypriot origin, a former British colony in his time, although as a child he had been sent to London to study. But his background only explained, at most, his great tolerance to heat. That's why I went straight to the point.
-Excuse me Mahmud, but I would like to ask you a question, if you don't mind: how come you walk so fast and agile?
I jokingly added that he looked more like someone on a countryside excursion in England than someone walking the Camino de Santiago. He laughed.
—Indeed, I usually go for walks on weekends through the fields of Oxfordshire, where I live.
The innkeeper approached us at that moment with a tray on which she carried glasses and a pitcher of lemonade with ice cubes. The lemonade was made with real lemon, you could see the slices floating.
—Look, I'm going to tell you something —Mahmud continued.
And then he explained to me that when he was forty-five years old, he decided to try running his first long race, a half marathon in London, and that he continued practicing afterwards, becoming a regular marathon runner.
"Wasn't it a bit late to start?" I asked, thinking about myself, who was about to turn precisely forty-five years old.
—Maybe so, but understand me, I did it out of curiosity, I knew I had qualities and wanted to see how far I could go, I never tried to compete.
But there was more. In April of that same year, he told me that at seventy-two years old, he had participated in the Atlas Ultramarathon (Ultra Trail Atlas) in Morocco, a race equivalent to six marathons held over six consecutive days, walking and running alternately through rocky mountains and deserts, carrying your food and drink in a backpack. And he had finished it.
—With seventy-two years old?!
The image of the old Japanese man with a wise oriental goatee came to mind, running down the mountain towards Ponferrada.
—Seventy-two then, yes. Now I am already seventy-three —he specified. And after a pause in which he finished his glass of lemonade, he added—: You will understand then, my friend, that doing the Camino is like going for a walk for me.
The German Friends of the Camino de Santiago Association was in charge of the hostel in the small village of La Faba, as the facilities had been restored with the money from a wealthy benefactor from that country, as stated on a plaque. The hospitaleros on duty at that time were a retired couple from Frankfurt who were there for three weeks (it was their third consecutive year there). The man's name was Frank, and while I chatted with Mahmud, he was sweeping the porch, while his wife, Daniela, was bustling around making sure everything was in order and serving lemonade to the arriving pilgrims.
The place was magnificent; it was composed of a large house that was the actual hostel, a small church inside which classical music played at a very low volume, and a garden area between both. The whole complex was surrounded by a low wall and trees that provided shade. In the middle, there was a bronze sculpture of a medieval pilgrim, and next to it, a fountain from which water flowed and where one could soak their feet.
When the clock struck two, Frank sat at a table on the porch with the registration book and the stamp, and began to check in the pilgrims in strict order of arrival. When it was my turn, he assisted me in Spanish, he handled it sufficiently, and said he was learning. He was meticulous with the information and the rules to follow at the hostel. Later, Daniela escorted me inside to assign me a bunk and show me around. Everything was perfect, very clean (there was hand soap and towels in the bathrooms!).
There was no communal dinner, there was a small store in the village where we could buy food. Neither Frank nor Daniela were the kind of people who enjoyed group socialization; they were too reserved for collective reflections made in a circle with candles passed around, although individually they were very interested in their guests. I appreciated that, because that was a good place to rest calmly before entering the supposedly crowded final stretch of the Camino in Galicia.
The surroundings and the calmness fostered conversation with the other pilgrims. In the afternoon, I sat outside on one of the benches. There were two women with Asian features who said they were Filipinas.
-Well, I am from the town where Miguel López de Legazpi was born -I said without adding any further information, convinced that this would spark a special interest in them.
"Yes, we know who it was, we studied him in school," said one of them, named Gilda, in a tone that seemed indifferent. "Nice guy, huh?"
I had the vague notion that, without having been a saint, López de Legazpi (conqueror of the Philippines and founder of Manila) was, at least historically, a figure worthy of consideration. Although it was also true that no Filipino tourists were ever seen visiting his birthplace by Zumarraga. In fact, according to them, the Spanish influence had not taken root in the Philippines. The other girl, named Imelda, said that, being a little older than Gilda, she had to study Spanish in school when she was young, but she had forgotten everything.
"Although there are words in dialect that remained from Spanish, such as 'mesa' or 'silla'," Gilda said in reference to the table and chair in front of her.
"Hey," Imelda asked, changing the subject, "and being Spanish, how do you feel about walking the Camino and being in your own country at the same time?"
—Well, I suppose it's more comfortable for me than for you all, although the truth is, during the last few weeks I have disconnected from everything and I feel more identified with pilgrims like you all than with Spaniards who are not part of this.
"Because you are a true pilgrim," Frank intervened, coming to sit with us. "Around here, noisy groups of Spaniards pass by who pretend to be pilgrims but are nothing more than tourists taking advantage of our voluntary work."
I was completely right, although I couldn't help but smile when I saw in him a responsible German complaining about the impudence of the Spanish, a whole cliché that was repeated. It occurred to me that the same thing would happen with the natives of any other country, in case the Camino passed through it. We continued chatting with the background sound of water falling in the fountain. It was true, I hadn't said it just to please those who were with me: truly, I felt as if I were part of that, of a floating country called the Camino de Santiago.



The German hostel in La Faba is a wonderful place. Although it may sound cliché coming from the hosts, it's true: everything is in order. And peaceful. To the right, the church, and next to it, the German retired couple welcoming pilgrims. To the left, the hostel's porch, where you can sit on benches and chairs to chat.

           24. La Faba — Triacastela (25.5 km)
Despite the cold of the morning, the hosts of the La Faba hostel, Frank and Daniela, would go out to the porch to bid farewell to the pilgrims. Shaking our hands, they wished us all a "buen Camino" and we thanked them for their hospitality. Then Daniela, with the satisfaction and tranquility of a job well done, even allowed herself a small moment of relaxation with her guests.
"I have a question for you," she said.
Wow, what could it be?
And like a mother, she asked me if I had the documentation, the ID, the phone, the cane, the backpack... Yes to everything.
—Well, then you can go now —and she gave me a little tap on the shoulder and started laughing by herself like I hadn't seen her do before.
I still couldn't know it, but it turned out that La Faba was the last of the hostels with volunteer hospitaleros where I stayed, in Galicia nothing was going to be the same in this regard.
The day began to break, once again the clear sky was going to allow me to see the sunrise. It was convenient to have some natural light from the beginning of the ascent, because the path was rocky. On the sides, cows grazing could be seen, and I was eager to enter Galicia, to see "Galicia" written on a sign. Since my blisters didn't hurt yet, I enjoyed the climb and in an hour and a half I was already at the top of the mountain, in O Cebreiro, a Celtic village of stone and slate that seemed to me to be too reconstructed and arranged for tourists.
O Cebreiro was an emblematic place on the Camino, but the truth is that I didn't pay too much attention to its church or the treasures it contained. I was more interested in regaining strength with a portion of tortilla and a café con leche. While I was having breakfast, a group of builders entered the bar and leaned on the counter, all wearing caps and dressed in identical blue overalls. They must have been working on a nearby construction site and had come in for coffee. They were speaking in Galician, a very distinct Galician dialect. I was definitely in Galicia.
A rural Galicia, that of the lost villages of Lugo. Because even though O Cebreiro was touristic, the rest of the small towns I passed through that day didn't seem that way to me, although there were establishments for pilgrims in all of them. But the few villagers that could be seen were dedicated to livestock farming: the settlements smelled of stable and their streets were marked by splatters of cow dung from the cows that had passed by on their way to pasture (it was almost impossible not to step on something). The men wore their inevitable blue overalls and the women wore aprons, both with rubber boots. The only thing missing was the rain, the moss that invaded the stone walls must be missing it.
I don't know if it was the heat, the accumulated kilometers, the downhill slope towards Triacastela, or all of it together, but the fact is that the damn blisters started hurting me again. What amazed me was the contrast between how much they made me suffer and how quickly they stopped: just sitting on a bar terrace and taking off my shoes was enough to feel instant relief. But then, continuing was torture; my feet would become furious.
I came across an elderly man who was walking slowly with the help of a cane. I identified with him and was about to wish him a "¡buen Camino!" (good journey), but at the last moment I realized he was an old man and my greeting might sound like a joke.
However, there was something new that helped lift our spirits: the official milestones that mark the Way in Galicia. They appeared frequently and had a plaque indicating the distance to Santiago (in meters!), so every time I left one behind, I was glad that there was less to go.
Between the slow pace and the repeated stops to refuel, I was practically left behind and ended the stage very late, around four in the afternoon. I was in so much pain that I didn't even worry about whether there would be space available at the hostel; I simply headed towards the Xunta de Galicia public hostel, which was the first thing one encountered upon arriving in Triacastela. It turns out there were indeed plenty of free spots.
The hostel consisted of two barracks with large windows, located next to a grassy esplanade. It was from the time of the Xacobeo 93, the first Holy Year that Manuel Fraga promoted with great fanfare to boost tourism in Galicia. In this and other hostels built around that time, one could notice the investment made and the willingness to provide the Camino de Santiago with modern infrastructure. The Triacastela hostel opened that same year, 1993, and at first glance it might have seemed nice, although it had become a bit outdated. Furthermore, it was not very welcoming due to its more aesthetic than functional design and lack of maintenance.
Later on, I found out that many people preferred private hostels because for a few extra euros they provided other amenities (such as having kitchen utensils available, because the Xunta hostels had a kitchen but nothing else, no pots or cutlery). So, there were no issues with space for reasons like these, and when I arrived, the manager assigned me a bunk bed in a small room with a swinging door. I shaved, showered, put cream on my feet, washed and hung my clothes, and in between all that, I got to know my roommates, a young Italian couple and Paula, a German girl.
I went to the pharmacy in Triacastela, which was called The Pilgrim's Apothecary. Like in Frómista, I was convinced that they would give me good advice there, because they necessarily had to be specialists in foot ailments. When I showed the blisters to the pharmacist, she didn't think it was serious. She recommended me some Compeed brand dressings, some strips that, she told me, would protect the area, promote fluid reabsorption, and alleviate the pain. She warned me not to remove them, as they would fall off on their own after a few days once they had fulfilled their function.
Ready. I felt happy, the problem was on its way to being solved. I decided to go back to the hostel to rest for a while. I was walking on eggshells, very careful with every step I took because my foot hurt a lot even with the walking sandals, it must have looked a bit pitiful. On the way, I noticed a very old billboard, with a rusty structure and a faded background. But despite being faded, what caught my attention in it was the unmistakable figure of Pelegrín, the popular mascot that became the logo of the Xacobeo 93. Pelegrín! How could I forget him, a character that at the time became as familiar to us as Cobi or Curro.
Upon arriving at the esplanade in front of the hostel, I noticed that about half a dozen young people in their twenties had sat in a circle on the grass around Dante, the Argentine who was Marta's son and happened to play the guitar. Among them were, among others, the Italian couple from my room, the Belgian from Foncebadón who was with her mother, and Andrea, the "guiri" from Madrid. The girls seemed delighted with the music and the seductive style of the Argentine. The scene had a sort of university campus or youth hostel vibe. I stood there watching them from a distance and realized the gap that separated me from them: those boys and girls were the same age as Pelegrín, they must have been born twenty-five years ago. The day before yesterday. And I thought, without envy, that the world of young people looking for excitement was also present along the Camino, but it was already far from me.
I had dinner at a place that looked really nice called Complexo Xacobeo (it was also a hostel and pilgrim's refuge, hence the "complex" part). At the Triacastela hostel, I had already checked that I wouldn't be able to charge my phone at night (there were outlets in the room, but they didn't work), so when I entered the restaurant, I asked the waiter if he could seat me at a table with a plug nearby.
"Any one," he told me without stopping in his busy pace.
What do you mean, just any table? I didn't see any available tables around there.
But he immediately reappeared and handed me an external battery to charge my phone. It had a sticker that read: "Complexo Xacobeo. Do not forget to return it. Thank you." When setting the table, he used a paper as a tablecloth that contained all the information (including a map) for the stage of the next day between Triacastela and Sarria. This was indeed a restaurant oriented towards pilgrims.
I ordered Galician broth and stewed tongue. I was having the broth when I heard behind me the dry thud of a bottle tipping over on the table and then the sound of the liquid pouring onto the floor like a waterfall. I caught a whiff of wine.
"Oh my god!" I heard someone say behind me, in a hurry. "Oh my god!" he repeated at a low volume, saying it to himself. It was the unmistakable voice and accent of an Asian, perhaps Korean. "My mistake, oh my god!"
That "my mistake," my error, meaning "my fault," was what made me feel a lot of pity for him. Because, besides, it was most likely that a moment before he was enjoying the happiness of a delicious dinner cheered by the wine. And now he had ruined everything.
I could have turned around to offer him my help, to show him at least my understanding. But I didn't. I kept facing away from the scene, without turning around even once. The Asian man stayed in his place, waiting for the waiter to arrive like a child waits for the adult after misbehaving.
But the waiter didn't come over because he was serving other tables. A couple of diners sitting in front of me noticed the mess and, pointing at my neighbor, told the waiter:
—Paco, come over here to that guy over there, it looks like he has messed with you.
Paco made a face of annoyance. Moments later, a woman came with a bucket and a mop, and the same Paco behind her, with a new bottle of wine.
—No, no, no, no —said the Korean—. My mistake, my mistake —he repeated.
I didn't want them to replace his wine. He said he was done, asked for the check, and left. He must have walked past me, but I didn't notice him.
For dessert, I ordered a fruit salad that was served to me in a scallop-shaped dish. With the first spoonful, I felt a cramp in my stomach. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, thinking it would pass. But the sharp stomach pain persisted, and I couldn't even move. I got scared because maybe I would have to ask for help and I didn't know anyone there. After what felt like endless minutes, finally, little by little, it started to subside. I got up to pay, leaving the fruit salad untouched on the table. I arrived at the hostel feeling a bit dizzy, but as soon as I passed by the bathroom, everything returned to normal and I forgot what had happened.



The Xacobeo Complex, in Triacastela, is a place oriented towards pilgrims: they provide you with an external battery to recharge your phone while you have dinner, they place a paper with all the information for the next day's stage as a tablecloth, and the charming detail of the tableware shaped like a scallop shell. And they treat you well, even though pilgrims are, in principle, just passing customers.
25. Triacastela - Sarria (17.8 km)
I left the Triacastela hostel and went to the Complexo Xacobeo for breakfast. There I met David, a man from Alicante who was roughly my age, with whom I had been coinciding in public hostels lately, although we had never spoken before. He invited me to join him at the table, where he was nibbling on a toast with tomato and olive oil alongside his coffee.
"Hey, have you happened to see an older Japanese man who looks really stressed out and is walking with two canes?" he asked me.
—One with a goatee, running?
—Yes, that one.
—I went downhill towards Ponferrada, but I only saw him at that stage, why?
—I am looking for him to return my cane to me.
He explained to me what had happened to him. That man arrived around four in the afternoon at the room of the hostel in Ponferrada where David had settled. He seemed shattered. Without introducing himself to anyone or taking a shower, he went straight to bed.
—And at night, at four in the morning, the alarm goes off, man, waking us all up. The guy gets up, gets ready in the dark, and takes off. And when I later go to grab my ski poles, I find that one is missing. I ask the others and it turns out that the one left there without an owner is a black one, similar to mine but surely belongs to the Japanese guy, who must have been so sleepy that he got confused and took mine.
David appropriated it and now he was walking with mismatched poles, looking for the Japanese man to recover his own. I remembered the look of concentration that man had on his face as he descended the dangerous mountain trail. This must be precisely the problem of pushing yourself to the limit in a challenge like this: along with the physical effort, the concentration required to avoid crashing left you exhausted, with no energy to pay attention to anything else.
Upon leaving Triacastela, one could continue through the San Xil valley or head towards the monastery of Samos. The guidebook mentioned that both routes were extremely beautiful, but the one through Samos was 7.2 kilometers longer. With my blisters, I wasn't up for many joys, so I turned right towards San Xil. David, in better physical shape than me despite also coming from afar (he had started in Roncesvalles), went towards Samos.
And indeed, the stage passed through natural environments where oak forests predominated. In many sections, the path was at a lower level compared to the surrounding terrain, these were the so-called "congostras" or "corredoiras," very common in Galicia. Several factors seemed to have contributed to the erosion and subsequent formation of these paths, but it was nice to think about the contribution made by the footsteps of the walkers over time. When these corridors were downhill, and if they also meandered, then it seemed like you were descending on a slide, and if it hadn't been for the impediment and blisters, maybe I would have been encouraged to raise my arms like a pair of wings to start running downhill and enjoy it, and who knows, maybe even break my neck.
Upon reaching the Sarria district, I got the impression of entering a Pyrenean town close to a ski resort, due to the slate roofs of some apartment buildings scattered here and there among vacant lots. I suppose that the abundance of hotels and accommodations I saw also contributed to that feeling, evidence that many people passed through Sarria, including those who began their pilgrimage here to travel at least the last one hundred kilometers to Santiago.
On my way, I came across a tourist office and went in to clarify an issue that had been worrying me. I had heard that from Sarria onwards, it was necessary to get your credential stamped at least twice a day, so that in Santiago you could prove that you had walked at least this last stretch on foot and in this way they would give you the Compostela, the diploma that certified your pilgrimage. People usually collected stamps, had their credentials stamped at accommodations, churches, and emblematic places, as well as in bars and beach bars. However, I preferred to keep my "accordion" (as some called it, because of its folds) with just one daily stamp, that of the hostel.
The girl at the tourist office told me that, indeed, the double stamp was necessary for those who only did the last one hundred kilometers, but it was not clear to her in the case of long-distance pilgrims. She made a phone call to ask and they told her that when in doubt, stamp twice a day, what was the problem? "Any bar will stamp it for you," she said. Yes, I know, but I valued my credential a lot as proof of my long journey and I wanted it with meaningful stamps for me, those from my stay in the hostels where I had spent the night, and not with those from just any bar where I had had a coke.
Without clarifying it, I arrived at the Sarria hostel, belonging to the Xunta, like all public hostels in Galicia. It was located in a house in the old town of the city. At the reception, I found a lady with glasses perched on the tip of her nose, with cords hanging on both sides, sitting inside a glassed-in porter's lodge. There didn't seem to be much pilgrim movement. I approached the window and handed over my ID and credential. I noticed some photo frames on the table, imagining they contained pictures of her children. She unfolded my credential haphazardly and, dipping the stamp in ink, suddenly, I realized she was about to mechanically stamp it in the first available space she saw.
—NOOOOOO!! NOT THERE! —I shouted.
Too late, the only thing I managed to do was to slightly lessen the force with which she imposed the stamp. The damage was already done: she had broken the linearity that I had scrupulously followed until that moment, each stamp of the day adjacent to the previous one. I couldn't believe it. Didn't this woman know that for a pilgrim there was nothing more sacred than their credential?
I told him to put it back on, this time pointing to the right place. As for the smudge, maybe I could fix it with an eraser. When the registration process was finished, I asked him about the need for the double stamp from Sarria for someone like me, with a credential containing as many stamps as the ones I had.
"I don't know," she told me, as if it didn't concern her.
—But don't you think that coming from far away is not necessary?
—No idea.
"Wouldn't you be interested in knowing, in case someone else asks you about it?" I would have asked gladly. But I didn't dare. He looked at me expressionlessly over his glasses, as if looking at an object. It didn't even seem like he was going to show me where the rooms were.
—Could you please tell me where the rooms are located?
—The stairs upstairs —he said without flinching.
I had never visited Sarria before, and yet it felt like I was a local there all my life. When I went out to the balcony of the hostel to hang the clothes, just at that moment the Belgian girl and her mother were passing by the street, and greeting us loudly they told me they were staying in a nearby hostel. Later, when I went for a walk in the old town, empty at that time, suddenly I heard someone whistling and calling my name. I looked up and found the Filipino women from La Faba, waving at me from the window of their hostel. Later, I went to the drugstore to buy shampoo, which I had run out of, and there was the Italian guy who in San Martín had prepared the magnificent salad for us. In the supermarket where I bought a ready-made meal for dinner, there were pilgrims whom I greeted in the aisles. All of this had its uncomfortable side, as it was like being in my hometown, constantly mindful of greeting everyone. But on the other hand, I also found the comforting feeling of being part of a tribe there.
When I returned to the hostel with the groceries, I met up with Isidro and David. There weren't as many die-hard fans of the shows left, although they too were starting to get annoyed with those from the Xunta. There was no kitchen, only a microwave, but they managed just fine with some serrano ham, chorizo, and wine. That night, in the dining room, I had dinner accompanied by them and the anecdotes they shared.
Isidro, the Murcian man well into his years who got angry in Foncebadón because everything was in English and we were in Spain, was a good snorer, but he said that he wasn't sleeping well in the hostels either. He mentioned that the other day he was sleeping soundly at the one in O Cebreiro, until something woke him up.
- And then I open my eyes and I go and I find myself facing the screen of a cell phone that was shining its light on my face.
"Yes, yes," David said, "I was there. It was a Korean man who couldn't sleep because of the snoring, so he started looking for the snorer using his phone's light among the bunk beds."
Isidro, despite opening his eyes, continued half asleep and thought that someone was showing him the screen to read something on it, but he didn't understand what it said because those seemed like Chinese characters. Until fully waking up, he saw the Chinese man on top of him and realized what was happening.
—Come on, get out of here and put on some earplugs —he then told him—, unbelievable.



Between Triacastela and Sarria there are sections where the path is at a lower level compared to the surrounding terrain. These are common in Galicia and are called "congostras" or "corredoiras". It's nice to think that they were formed by erosion from the steps of walkers over time. When they are downhill and the path winds, it feels like you are on a slide.

26. Sarria - Portomarín (22.2 km)
I left the hostel and immediately went in to have breakfast at any of the establishments that were at the foot of the Camino, in the old town of Sarria. I ordered a café con leche and a slice of Galician bread toast and sat down. Shortly after, a blonde pilgrim with her hair tied back in a ponytail approached my table and spoke to me, but so quietly that I didn't understand her at first. She asked if she could sit there, as the other tables were occupied.
—Yes, of course.
She was drinking tea without milk and holding the cup with both hands, as if to warm them up. At that early hour, I didn't feel like engaging in conversation with anyone, but she seemed polite. She told me she was Swedish and asked me something, but again I couldn't hear her well because of the noise in the bar.
—"Eh??" I shouted loudly, to make him understand, annoyed because he didn't bother to speak to me a little louder.
From where he was coming from doing the Camino, he hurried to repeat, but without raising his tone either this time. If I understood him it was because I sharpened my ear and focused on his expression, which was delicate. He had a porcelain-white complexion and I had the feeling that he could break if he forced his thin voice. Without a doubt, I had disturbed her with my abrupt way of addressing her, her timid little eyes barely dared to look at me. I thought that it wasn't necessary to be a genius to guess what she was asking me, as they were the typical questions that pilgrims asked each other.
"From my house," I said, explaining where that was and softening the tone as much as I could. I saw myself reflected in her, feeling guilty. "And you?"
—From Saint Jean.
I found it surprising that that fragile being was doing the entire French Way. I assumed that he had been walking for at least close to a month, like me.
"No, I've been here for thirteen days," he told me.
Huh? It was half the time I had been taking, which meant he had been doing stages of forty kilometers or more. That didn't add up for me. Then he got up from the chair and walked over to the bar to pay for his tea and leave. I saw that he had huge legs, wrapped in black tights, his thighs were like those of a velociraptor, disproportionately large compared to his body. As he gathered his things, he moved nervously, as if he couldn't control the impulse of his engine, like a restless horse about to start trotting. Watching her leave, I thought about the uneven development that people can have in different aspects of our lives. That there were things that perhaps could be trained through effort and strength, to build muscle and run in life, although the necessary confidence to navigate it well, that couldn't be shaped in the same way.
It was clearly noticeable that there were more people on the Camino, there was a livelier atmosphere. Near the milestone indicating the last one hundred kilometers to Santiago, I met Kepa from Bilbao again. From a distance, I could already hear him coming from behind with his booming voice, he kept talking a lot and this time he was sharing his conversation with some young people who were walking together, one of whom was wearing the red and white striped shirt of Athletic Bilbao. As I passed by, Kepa greeted me in a friendly manner, he seemed happy and rejuvenated, wearing a bandana tied around his head like a pirate.
—Hey, how are you? —he asked me in Basque.
I told him it was fine. He looked at me without believing it. I think he felt a little sorry for me seeing me so alone.
"Do you want to come with us?" he suggested. "We're having a great time."
—No, thank you, I prefer to go at my own pace —I replied.
I was glad that he had found his people.
A little further on, as I was walking through a forest of oaks, a faint sound of bagpipes began to envelop me, a music that came from afar and to which I initially didn't pay much attention. But as it didn't stop and increased in volume, in the end it became evident to me and I gave it some thought: I assumed that I was approaching some establishment with folk music at full blast to attract customers. In the end, it turned out to be an authentic bagpiper (in his typical attire) who was playing the bagpipes in the middle of the forest in exchange for a donation, I hadn't considered that possibility.
I reached the milestone of the last one hundred kilometers. It was completely covered in graffiti, there was no room for a single more inscription. Whoever left their mark there knew the impact it would have worldwide, I even took a picture of it myself.
The blisters started bothering me towards the end of the stage, it didn't seem to me that those dressings were working completely, I was very tight on time. Even so, I caught up with a group of Koreans where the couple I had been intermittently greeting since the Hornillos hostel in Burgos was. I had met them on that occasion when I was having dinner with Toni in the dining room full of Asians, among whom were Emika and Shan Lee (I had lost sight of them a long time ago). The man was the one with the rice ball wrapped in seaweed, which he wrapped in kitchen cling film for the next day's breakfast.
Since then we had greeted each other, although I had hardly spoken to him and didn't even know his name. His English was very poor, but that didn't stop him from being a friendly guy who was always in a good mood (I had seen him with good pints of beer and empty bottles of red wine, it must be said). And you should have seen how he approached me, especially when it had been days since I last saw him and I was starting to forget about him. A couple of stages earlier, on a terrace in Triacastela, he saw me from afar and shouted at me while getting up from his chair and holding his pint up towards me.
That Korean guy was a riot. I confirmed it once again when I accompanied him, along with his wife and the rest of his group, on the final stretch of the stage. The descent towards the bridge that crossed the reservoir of the Miño River could be done by two different paths: one was easy but boring; the other was beautiful but demanding. We all agreed on which way to go. When the man saw that my choice coincided with his, he started laughing out loud, realizing that they were not the only ones who were not up for nonsense at that point on the Camino.
And when we crossed the bridge, and we came across the steep stairs that Portomarín uses to welcome pilgrims, that's when he really started laughing, and, raising his arms, he turned his back to them and asked please to take a picture of him so that there would be evidence of the joke they were playing on us.
The stairs were there to ascend to a completely rebuilt village on the hillside, as its original location, by the riverbank, had been flooded by the waters of the reservoir inaugurated by Francisco Franco in sixty-three. And the stones with which they had been built came from the disappeared medieval bridge that once allowed pilgrims to cross the Miño and enter the original Portomarín. So, seen in that light, it made sense for us to climb all those steps, to continue with the tradition.
The Koreans headed to a hostel where they could prepare their own food, and I went to the Xunta's audience, following my usual routine. The urban planning of Portomarín had a somewhat artificial feel because the entire town had been built at the same time and with the same pattern. Therefore, among the identical and semi-new houses, the sturdy Romanesque church stood out, which had been moved there stone by stone. Nearby, on Camilo José Cela street, was the hostel, a very striking building with a monolith in the shape of a Pilgrim in front and a plaque at the reception commemorating its opening in '93 by Mr. Manuel Fraga Iribarne.
Inside, the same tone of the last few days: there were washbasins but not just simple plastic tubs in which to soak clothes so that hand washing soap could take effect; the clotheslines were insufficient, the ropes hanging in the courtyard were all different, it was clear that they had been placed there by passing pilgrims; there were outlets but not a single power strip for all of us to recharge our phones peacefully without fighting over them. Those details (or lack thereof) irritated me; I decided to only wash the basics and left in a huff to the street to have a drink at a bar and take the opportunity to charge my phone in the meantime.
At night, my intention was to have dinner with what I had bought at the supermarket accompanied by Isidro and David and their anecdotes, just as I had done so comfortably in Sarria the day before. When I arrived with my bag, there were more people sharing a table with them in the dining room of the hostel. They were all Spanish and had just started the Camino de Santiago to cover the minimum of the last one hundred kilometers. From their lively conversation and the jokes they were making, I quickly understood that they had spent the afternoon together. The newcomers were two middle-aged men and two slightly older ones, and they came from different Spanish regions.
I had dinner with them and they offered me some of the wine they were sharing. But I didn't say a word (neither to drink nor to talk) because the laughter was getting louder and it turned into a "who can say the most outrageous thing" kind of situation. They were talking about the massage service they offered to pilgrims at a modest price in some place in Portomarín, and how David, with muscle pain, had decided to go that afternoon.
"Has there been a 'happy ending' or not?" one of them asked, laughing.
—Well, I wouldn't say no, buddy, because after so many days, you miss that massage more than the other.
—But was there then?
—No, damn it!, I already told you before that it was a man who gave it...
"And what does that have to do with anything?" another person interjected, who was eating some pre-cooked oriental noodles and stuck out his tongue to lick his lips obscenely, while placing a cardboard cup with the product brand in front of him: Yatekomo.
Explosion of laughter.
"Damn, with the amount of Chinese girls around here," a third person exclaimed, blatantly staring at Imelda and Gilda's backsides as they walked by, not understanding the reason for all the commotion.
At the moment the Filipinas were leaving the dining room, they turned around and caught me laughing shamelessly with the group of Spaniards. After that, I didn't dare to speak to them anymore.



This Korean (although looking like a Japanese from World War II) is a riot, he's always laughing. He even laughs at the stairs that you have to climb as a welcome to enter Portomarín, the end of the stage.
           27. Portomarín — Palas de Rei (24.8 km)
The path was becoming increasingly crowded, sometimes even forming crowds of large groups and associations whose members all wore the same distinctive shirt or scarf tied around their neck. As a result, there were fewer greetings exchanged, the "¡buen Camino!" was no longer heard as much, not only because it would have been cumbersome to repeat it like a parrot at every step, but because it seemed to no longer make sense in the more normalized environment that it was becoming.
It was well past mid-morning when I noticed a pilgrim who had veered off the path to sit on the grass in a scenic spot. As I walked by, I saw that the girl was reading a book. Even though she had her back to me, I recognized Paula, the young German woman I had crossed paths with two days earlier at the Triacastela hostel. I called out to greet her, and she turned around.
"You look great," I said. "It's the first time I've seen something like this on my trip."
I found that scene unusual, where a pilgrim takes his time at the edge of the road to read quietly while enjoying the landscape.
"I'm waiting for all the people to pass," he replied.
Paula had already told me that she never planned. The end of her stage was determined by her desire to stop and finish the day. She would go as far as she could and then look for a hostel, and if there was no room, she would look for another one without caring about walking further until she found an available spot.
In Triacastela, when we checked into the room, she said she was from Kassel: "Oh, yes, where Documenta is held," I said to impress her. "Do you know it?" she asked me, surprised. No, I had only read a novel (Kassel no invita a la lógica, by Enrique Vila-Matas) about this contemporary art event that took place in her city.
It was clear that she was a girl who marched to the beat of her own drum. That afternoon, while the young pilgrims gathered in the field in front of the hostel around a guitar, she was busy picking small, hard apples like stones from some wild apple trees nearby. I was sitting on a bench, engrossed in my phone, when she came over to offer me some. "They're good," she exclaimed as she sat down next to me to eat them.
I was running out of battery, and in that Xunta hostel, it was a problem because the outlets weren't working. That didn't affect Paula because she was without a phone; she had left it in Germany, turned off. "And the photos? Don't you take photos?" I asked her, not quite believing it. "No, I don't take photos." She did call her family from time to time to let them know she was okay, and that was enough.
The next morning, while the rest of us were packing up to leave early, Paula was still inside her sleeping bag. Shortly after, before leaving the room, I looked towards her bed and saw that she was already awake: without getting out of the sleeping bag, reclined on the bunk bed, she was having breakfast with some cereal and milk in an aluminum bowl. I wished her a Buen Camino. "Do you know where I can find deserts in Spain?" she asked me then. I told her I didn't know for sure, but besides the ones on the plateau, she would surely find them in the south. "That's what I plan to do, when I get to Santiago I'm going to head down to Seville via the Vía de la Plata," she said. I visualized it for a moment. "But wouldn't that be complicated, going in the opposite direction, looking for the arrows while facing backwards, interpreting them in reverse?" She seemed to consider it. "No, not at all," she said after a moment, smiling, "why would it be?"
Now, two days later, I found her again, this time reading a book at the edge of the road in that scenic spot. I didn't want to disturb her and said goodbye to her for the second (and last) time. Just a few meters ahead, I realized I had just missed the opportunity to take a picture of her. I could have taken it, since she had her back turned and it wouldn't have bothered her, especially considering she didn't like them. It would have been very useful for the blog, to accompany her story. I regretted it a lot, so much so that the thought of turning back to photograph her crossed my mind, but I noticed something very strong was preventing me from doing so. It wasn't just the blisters (which were bothering me again), the weight of the backpack, or having to walk the Camino against the flow, even if it was only for a short stretch. No, it was something more decisive that was related to the unique opportunity that one encounters unexpectedly and misses due to not paying attention. I started to reproach myself, but then I remembered that I always had the option of writing as a way to portray Paula afterwards.
The stage was becoming complicated for me because of the blisters that, from bothering me like in the last two days, went on to torment me as much or more than when I arrived in Triacastela, three stages ago. The pharmacy dressings were not doing their job because underneath them, on the soles of my feet, I could feel the blisters throbbing. I was overwhelmed, not paying attention to anything except the distress that was clouding my mind. I wondered if I could make something useful out of it, extract some lesson related to suffering, I don't know, what I was experiencing felt like penance and maybe I could pay attention to the pain I was feeling, accompany it and accept it to see that despite the torture I was capable of moving forward, things like that.
Nonsense, that was not an induced psychological discomfort, but a full-blown ordeal that only served to distance me from everything and everyone, starting with myself. I was not aware of where I was going or cared about it. I was merely a being at the service of that torment, with no resources left for anything else, and all I wanted was to reach the shelter and have it all end. I only regained myself when I stopped at the bars, and then I understood that, at most, that burden served me to enjoy more of those respites in which I indulged in coffee with milk, Spanish omelette bites, and beers that tasted like heavenly bliss. I realized that it was time to rest for a whole day because it seemed impossible to continue the next day.
I finally managed to reach Palas de Rei and headed as usual to the public hostel, located in the center of the town. It had the same shortcomings as the previous ones, with the added inconvenience that in this one the facilities were even older, it wasn't even nice. I didn't care. After shaving, showering, applying foot cream (as best as I could), washing and hanging my clothes, I sat down to rest outside, on a bench next to the entrance door of the hostel.
I took my feet out of the sandals to let them breathe. They looked like a mess because the bandages were halfway falling off, giving them a horrible appearance. The adhesive strips had gotten stuck to my socks, and when I took them off at each stop that day, I ended up partially peeling them off my skin. The water from the shower had definitively stripped them of their adhesive power, so it looked like I had rags hanging from my feet. And to top it off, the bandages were a flesh cream color, so it was no wonder that a pilgrim got scared when passing by me, looked at my feet, and thought that my flesh was falling off in pieces, like a leper or a pilgrim with feet gangrenous from the fire of Saint Anthony.
I finished pulling off the bandages completely, and then I went to the nearest pharmacy to the hostel. Even walking hurt a lot when I stepped, so definitely the next day I would have to find a hostel to stay quietly during the day. At the pharmacy, they recommended me to drain the blisters and rest. According to them, due to the location of the blisters, it had been a mistake not to do it before covering them with the bandages. I bought some hypodermic needles and then went to a supermarket to buy something light to eat. When I returned to the hostel, I found David, Isidro, and the group from the previous day at the entrance, making plans to go shopping and have dinner together.
- Are you not joining us?
—No, I'm exhausted —I told them.
I went to my bunk to attend to my wounds. After that, I practically didn't move from there because I was comfortable resting my feet; they didn't hurt if I didn't put weight on them. I looked at accommodation options for the next day on my phone; there was no shortage in Palas de Rei. I felt like treating myself, and to imagine myself living like a king, I searched for a hotel called "Hotel Palas," but it didn't seem to exist with that exact name (there was, however, a "Pensión Palas," but it wasn't the same). Then, I spent a lot of time on the blog because that day, not having been able to pay much attention, I had very little real material to share and had to invent some stories.
At dusk, I let myself be carried away by a very pleasant half-sleep. At a certain moment, I was awakened by the laughter and revelry of the group who were dining together in the hostel's dining room. I identified Isidro, who started singing some verses with a lot of feeling and a very powerful voice, like that of an Antonio Molina. As he finished the piece, there were cheers, applause, and cheers (and laughter, poor Isidro) in the revelry that the others were having. I was glad not to be with them, I preferred to rest in my bunk, calm and alone, but connected through the chronicle I had just finished writing.
28. Palas de Rei - Arzúa (28.5 km)
I slept very well and in the morning I waited for people to leave and the dormitory to clear before getting up and planning my day. As I got off the bunk bed and took the first steps, I realized that my blisters didn't hurt. My feet looked better than the day before. I put on my slippers and said to myself, "What am I going to do all day long in this town?" I felt encouraged to see how far I could go. Maybe I would reach Melide, halfway through the journey; this way, perhaps I could complete what was left to Santiago in four simple stages instead of the three official ones.
I started walking calmly, consciously, and then I realized I was doing fine. As the morning progressed, but especially as I approached the end of the short stage to Melide that I had planned (fourteen kilometers), I realized that I could continue further and, who knows, maybe even finish normally in Arzúa.
When I arrived in Melide, I smelled octopus as I passed by some low buildings. There was a half-open small window and I leaned in to look. Inside, I saw a man with a pile of octopuses that he was cutting the heads off with a knife. A few steps away was the famous pulpería Ezequiel. It was only eleven in the morning, and for how big the place is, there were very few people. At one of the long tables, Isidro and David were finishing a portion of octopus they had shared. Since they didn't give me a very warm welcome, I sat next to them but not with them, leaving a gap between us. They continued to barely pay attention to me, and remembering how much fun I had had in their company and with their anecdotes just a couple of days ago, I felt hurt. They soon got up to pay and left without remembering to say goodbye to me. After all, I thought, it was me who had distanced myself first.
I ordered Galician broth and a portion of octopus. To drink, a glass of Ribeiro wine. Without explaining anything, the waiter placed a whole bottle of wine and a rustic handleless cup on the table (and I had asked for a "glass" of Ribeiro). I assumed that serving the whole bottle was the norm at the restaurant, that they didn't hold back, so I didn't complain. I told myself that since I would have to pay for it anyway, I was going to drink with purpose. And so I did, I generously poured the broth and octopus. The wine ended up making me sentimental and I remembered Toni. I sent him a message:
Hello Toni, I'm at Ezequiel's pulpería in Melide, just as you recommended. I'm on my way to Arzúa, but I stopped to treat myself: broth, octopus, and Ribeiro wine. I've had my share of adventures these days, things got complicated with the blisters (the descent to Ponferrada from Cruz de Ferro was tough). But here I am, about to reach Santiago. I hope you're descending well along the Primitivo, I assume you'll come to this same place where I am now. Thank you very much for your recommendations and teachings, you see that I've followed them to the letter. A hug.
When I finished my lunch and went to pay, I found out that, for the bottle of Ribeiro wine, they were only charging me for the approximate amount that you had drunk. Well, it was no big deal, I felt happy. Before leaving the place, I received Toni's response in the form of a voice message he had recorded while walking:
Nothing, I'm glad you're having a good time. Thanks to you for putting up with me. And, what else? About the feet and all that, remember that you're Basque, you've got nothing left, you've already got it, I mean, with determination, just keep going, what's left is nothing. And me around here, well, El Salvador was tougher for me than this, it's also a rollercoaster. Otherwise, everything's fine. I'm a bit tired too, you know, on the uphills I sound like a puffing locomotive. And as for my feet and all that, well, I'm doing fine. Okay? So, I repeat, I'm really happy for you. Take care, a hug.
When I left the general store, it was raining. It was the first time it rained on me during the trip. I had no choice but to wear the cape I had bought specifically for the Camino. I was a bit hesitant to put it on because with the backpack bulging out behind me, I would look like a hunchback. But soon I saw pilgrims wrapped in ponchos, so I stepped aside and put on the raincoat as well. Shortly after, as we were leaving the urban area of Melide to enter a eucalyptus forest, I felt like I was part of a column of porters.
It wasn't raining very hard, but my sneakers were getting wet, and that could also be a cause for concern, since my footwear was completely permeable. When I was preparing for the trip, I had given a lot of thought to this issue because, like in Formula 1 races, it was important to choose between rain tires or dry tires before the start, as I couldn't carry both pairs due to the weight. Anticipating the heat of the plateau and to prevent my feet from getting overheated, I opted for the dry ones, a pair of lightweight and breathable summer sneakers. But now I was faced with the problem of water, because walking with wet feet was very bad due to the increased risk of blisters. Just when it seemed like my blisters were finally giving me a break.
However, the rain turned into drizzle and finally stopped falling. I kept moving forward slowly, with the lenses of my glasses covered in droplets that didn't let me see well, but happy because things were progressing. The blisters were still there and the discomfort eventually appeared, but it was nowhere near the torment of the previous day. Besides, worst-case scenario, I was almost in Ribadiso de Baixo, a village that had a magnificent Xunta hostel on the edge of a river and was only three kilometers away from the last climb ending in Arzúa.
I was close to completing the official stage, which was one of the longest (almost thirty kilometers), and I wondered if my feet would finally be healing. I couldn't know. But it seemed clear that it was a matter of taking it day by day. Or even moment by moment, because, feeling victorious as I descended a fairly steep path towards Ribadiso de Baixo, I stepped awkwardly on some tree roots sticking out of the ground and almost twisted my ankle and ended up on the ground. What a scare. When I recovered from the fright, I remembered what Toni had told me about what it meant to reach these final stages of the Camino: being so close, there was no stopping a pilgrim; if necessary, people were capable of crawling the last kilometers on the ground just to reach Santiago.
The only thing I visited in Arzúa was its main street, very long, through which one entered the town and where the shops and hospitality establishments for pilgrims were located. It didn't seem to me to be a town with much charm, although there was, indeed, a great crowd of people. Just as in Melide the French Way welcomed the Primitive Way (which Toni was descending from Oviedo), in Arzúa the Northern Way flowed into (which runs along a good part of the Cantabrian coast from Irún), and I suppose that, with the contribution of these two tributaries, the river of the Way became a great estuary here near its sea in Santiago.
The Xunta hostel was located in a large house in the center. It was uncomfortable and followed the same pattern as the previous ones in terms of the few facilities it offered. In the facilities, before getting into the shower, I was shaving in front of the mirror when one of the members of the group of Spaniards that had formed in the last two hostels entered, one who was middle-aged and whose name I never remembered.
"Even with a razor and all, huh?" he said with a mocking tone as he headed towards one of the toilet stalls.
It hurt me. The truth was that I didn't remember seeing any other pilgrims with electric razors in the time I had been traveling, although I hadn't paid much attention either. Many men didn't shave, and I imagined the rest would use razors, lighter to carry. Would they think I was a snob? A pampered weakling? Because that guy would tell the others in the group, I was sure of that, after all, I had avoided them.
Damn it, I said to myself. The last thing I needed was to worry at this point in the journey about a comment like that, what a jerk. There didn't seem to be anyone else but us in those inner bathrooms, and I came up with a way to get back at him. I had noticed that the fluorescent lights, in addition to turning on, all turned off from a single switch next to the door (typical of these aging hostels). I turned off the electric razor and waited. Then I heard the sound of effort followed by something, plop, falling into the toilet bowl, and I quickly left the restroom turning off the lights and leaving the man in the dark in the middle of his task, while I heard him shout for someone to turn them back on, damn it. I went to my bunk, I would see if I would shower a little later (I didn't, the showers had curtains and the change of clothes had to be left outside).
How could I do that? I was not that kind of person, not at all, and now I had complicated my existence by fearing the reaction of that individual (and the rest of the gang). In the room, I changed my clothes and went out to the street, looking for a bar to take refuge with my cell phone, my notebook, and a beer. Then I went to a supermarket and bought bread, a ready meal, and a yogurt for dinner. Lunch at the pulpería was already far away and I was hungry, so I told myself that I would have dinner early to avoid meeting the others. I heated the ready meal in the hostel's microwave and then, when I was halfway through the plate, David appeared in the dining room carrying a bunch of bread loaves. He said that they had organized a joint dinner for the night.
-Why don't you come, buddy? There will be a lot of people, more have signed up - he told me-. Besides, Isidro has promised us a new copla recital, you can't imagine how much we laughed yesterday.
David seemed like a nice guy, that "nano" (pronounced nanu) who addressed you made me feel accepted. More people started to show up, carrying plastic bags with snacks and bottles. They began to prepare dinner and I, feeling alert and uncomfortable, decided to leave. It saddened me to let him down, maybe he would take it as a lack of consideration or rudeness on my part. Or maybe he wouldn't even notice. I tried at least to say goodbye as I was leaving the dining room, but he was engrossed in his conversations and laughter with the others.
"Whatever is left and nothing is the same," Toni had told me, encouraging me that morning in his voice message. And in the pain, time is on my side, I thought. And the time I had left, I wanted to use it for something meaningful to me, so I went to the bunk bed to rest and write for the blog.
In the bedroom, I found the person I had played a trick on in the bathroom earlier that afternoon. Nothing happened. I suppose he was too embarrassed to tell anyone and risk being laughed at for what had happened to him. In fact, he even had a kind gesture towards me when he finished charging his phone and offered me the plug.



Suddenly, the word "vapors" came to mind. The ones my mother used to prepare for me when I was little, for colds and sinusitis. My senses processed this aroma and only then did I understand: it smelled like vapors because the forest I was entering was of eucalyptus trees and, after so many days of sun, it was finally raining.
           29. Arzúa — O Pedrouzo (19.3 km)
There were only two stages left, and both were simple, just about twenty kilometers each. It was already done. I left the hostel and went straight into the bar across the street. I ordered a coffee with milk and a slice of Galician bread toast. Once I had breakfast, with the daylight, I set off. After the rain from the previous day, the weather was nice again, the sky was clear. Oak and eucalyptus forests alternated with small villages surrounded by cows, pastures, and cornfields. Everything was flowing, with the amount of people walking I felt like I was swimming as part of a school of fish downstream. There were even parents with children, which was quite a novelty, because it was the first time I had seen "niñogrinos" (an acronym I came up with when I saw them, just to have some fun). The truth is that it was Sunday and they were enjoying a family hike.
Near O Pedrouzo, I came across a middle-aged man, with a ponytail and loose hippie-style clothing, waiting for the pilgrims to pass by next to the stand he had set up in the pavilion of a park. I walked past, glancing out of the corner of my eye, as I always do in these cases, but a few meters ahead I stopped, reflecting: it was a book he was offering.
I retraced my steps. The man was showing his book to a pilgrim at that moment, so I was able to browse calmly. On a low table covered with a lilac tablecloth, he had stacked some volumes next to a stamp for credentials, a saucer with candies, and another one for donations. The set-up was like a small altar, although it lacked incense. I picked up a copy. It was quite thick and heavy. Shared solitude. What a good title for a book. The cover displayed an image of a sunset over the sea and the following quote: "The awakening of consciousness is inevitable if you dare to face the void of uncertainty." It was signed by someone named Walter. He approached me right away.
"Did you write it?" I asked.
It was supposed to, although on the book flap, as the author, there was a photo of a Labrador dog named Flan (it was the same color as a flan).
"We wrote it together, Flan and I, we are both the authors. I'm Walter, nice to meet you," he said, shaking my hand and then bending down to pet Flan, who had meanwhile approached us."
Walter was Argentinean and had written the book while walking the Camino de Santiago a few years ago. Without rushing: in the morning he walked and in the afternoon he wrote. Now he lived on the Camino, literally, as he slept in his van, parked right there, next to the pavilion. He was delighted with the public's response to his work, he had reprinted it for the fifth time and even had an English version. I congratulated him. Truly, I thought it was very commendable to write a book. However, I told him that in my backpack it was forbidden for even a gram more of weight to enter.
"But a book doesn't weigh anything," he told me.
No, not at all, I thought. Especially this one, with almost five hundred pages.
—How much does it cost?
—Willpower —he replied. It was clear that he had rehearsed the answer—: we are on the Way and here things have no price, they go by donation.
I leafed through it, hesitating. But I read some phrases that were both poetic and wise, with words like "Love" or "Universe" written with an initial capital letter, which sounded like New Age spirituality to me. I told him I needed to look at it a little more and he gave me the address of a bookstore in Santiago where I could also find it. O Pedrouzo was just around the corner, and Santiago, so to speak, as well; that's why, as I walked away from his stand, I understood that Walter had chosen the exact spot to place his voluminous book very well.
In O Pedrouzo, disoriented, I passed in front of the Xunta hostel without realizing it, as it was a bit hidden behind a building at the very entrance. The town reminded me of Arzúa, here too the urban center was accessed through a nondescript main street, with residential blocks on both sides, whose ground floors were full of bars, restaurants, and shops. I got the impression of being in a touristy place, because a guy stationed on the sidewalk was handing out flyers for the restaurant behind him, which offered special menus for pilgrims. The offer was wide and I kept walking a little further. I had left the hostel behind, but I decided to stay there and have something to eat before returning, settling in and sleeping in a shared room for my last night.
At the hostel, I had a pleasant surprise. At the reception, instead of a counter or a glass booth to stand in front of, there was a table with a couple of chairs for the pilgrim to sit down upon arrival, a thoughtful gesture during the check-in process.
—"It has cooled down, hasn't it?" commented the woman in charge as she wrote down my information.
Indeed, it was sunny but a cold autumn wind had picked up.
"If you're cold, just let me know and I'll turn the heating up a bit," he added.
The cordiality of that woman was leaving me stunned.
"Do you mind if I put you in a top bunk?" she asked me. "It's just that everyone keeps asking for the bottom ones and I'm running out, and if someone really needs it..."
The truth is that I was fed up with always getting the top bunk, especially because I hadn't dared to ask the previous stern caretakers to switch me to a bottom one. But now I had the opportunity to do it, that woman was kind and made me feel confident enough to ask for it. I could use any of the excuses that other pilgrims used, especially the Spanish ones. In fact, just a moment ago I had heard two nearsighted young men who were ahead of me say that they needed to sleep at the bottom bunk so that, just in case they needed them, they could have their glasses handy that they kept in their backpack at night.
"Sure, no problem," I said, however, accepting a top bunk.
I never found it easy to claim something, not even when it was straightforward. But in that case, grateful for the treatment of that woman, I felt indebted to her and I loved having the opportunity to reciprocate by making her job easier. Had she been in the position for a short time?
When I entered the bedroom, I found my dear gang there, sprawled out at the foot of the area where I was going to sleep, and I understood that, with a little more time in that position, that hospitable woman would most likely become another supervisor like the ones I had encountered so far. Or else, to avoid alienating herself, she would quit her job.
At dusk, I went out for a walk around O Pedrouzo. It was Sunday and a cold wind was blowing. Here and there, some pilgrims could be seen, but in general, the streets looked deserted. Lately, I didn't come across many of those who had been at my pace during the journey. I knew that some had deserted the public hostels, but still, I didn't see them on the street or on the road. Perhaps they had fallen behind, or more likely, they had moved ahead taking advantage of the fact that the last two stages were short. In any case, on that melancholic evening, in the inhospitable O Pedrouzo, I missed them and wondered where they could be.
As I had nothing to do, I went to see where to continue the next morning. On the outskirts of the town, there was a milestone with a plaque that read: "Km 19.308". It seemed incredible to me that the journey was about to end after almost a month and nearly seven hundred kilometers traveled. Arriving in Santiago, the question among the pilgrims was whether to continue to Finisterre or not. "Are you going to Finisterre?" the group asked me. They were all going, together. No, it was enough for me. The goal was Santiago, and Finisterre was just the extension of an experience that was ending for me the next day, with its good part because it was finally over, and also with its bad part because unfortunately it was ending. But it was important to give it the intensity it deserved. In the future, I could continue doing more Caminos, or maybe the same one, again. But it seemed to me that that first Camino that was about to end was also, in a way, the last one. So I returned to the hostel full of anticipation and nervousness for what awaited me the next day.
30. O Pedrouzo - Santiago de Compostela (19.4 km)
I woke up from a restless dream around one in the morning. I climbed down from the bunk bed very carefully, trying not to make any noise so as not to wake the person below. In the darkness, I had to feel my way around to avoid tripping over the backpacks that had been left next to the beds. Loud snores could be heard coming from different people, each with their own particular sound and rhythm. As I crossed the warm room towards the restroom, I had the sensation of being in an engine room or in the belly of a mechanism that resembled a sleeping monster.
That morning almost everyone woke up very early, many did so at five to arrive in Santiago early. It wasn't clear to me why there was such a rush to get there, although it was true that, once in Santiago, the pilgrim had to fulfill quite a few rituals. In any case, I decided to take it easy because I wanted to savor the last stage, so, drowsy, I waited for the majority of people to leave before getting up.
I left the hostel later than ever, almost at eight, the deadline. I had breakfast at the first café I found and then hit the road with daylight. There was a lot of pilgrim traffic. The landscape was typical of the last days, mainly composed of eucalyptus forests. I noticed how my steps automatically followed the yellow arrows and milestones, as if after so many days of training, these signals had been incorporated into a navigation system in my brain, an autonomous mechanism that took care of finding them and guiding me without me having to worry about it. Perhaps that's why I was more receptive than ever to the changes taking place in the landscape, to the background noise of a highway, the roar of planes at the airport that had to be skirted, or the murmur of the city getting closer and closer.
My wife had written me a message telling me to wave at a webcam that the Galician television had placed in their facilities, located next to the Camino just before Monte do Gozo. When I arrived at the place, I called her to let her know and to indicate where I had to look, because there was no sign of the presence of said camera and I couldn't see it. When I finally figured out where it was, some pilgrims passed by my side and saw me waving my hand towards a lamppost.
It was already close to noon and I was about to reach Monte do Gozo (less than a kilometer away) when I decided to delay the pleasure of seeing Santiago a little longer by indulging in another delight: entering a bar to eat a slice of Spanish omelette accompanied by a nice cold beer. I was already celebrating it.
A while later, I arrived at the bulky monument located at the top of the hill. I was disappointed to find out that from there, the city couldn't be seen due to the growth of some trees blocking the view. Furthermore, I missed the sculptures of the two expressive medieval pilgrims pointing at the cathedral towers as the end of their long journey, an image that I had engraved in my memory since I had seen it in photos. Where were they? I squinted a little through the dry mountain due to the drought and I glimpsed them in the distance, lonely, about five hundred meters from where I was. I walked towards them through the park trails, increasingly deserted as I moved away from the Camino. In fact, when I reached the landing where the sculptures were planted, I found myself completely alone, and with my presence, I scared off some magpies that flew away cawing. Now, I could see Santiago and the cathedral towers in the background, and I felt close to the joy of those two huge bronze figures that accompanied me.
I waited for someone to come because I wanted to take a picture of myself. It seemed incredible to me that no one was approaching, but it was true that deviating to this place meant walking an extra kilometer and Santiago was just a stone's throw away. After about a quarter of an hour, a couple of pilgrims finally appeared.
Upon descending from Monte do Gozo, I found myself on the outskirts of Santiago. In the book "The Immortal Way," I had read that the entrance to the city via the French Way was unattractive, but to me it didn't seem so much. There was no red carpet waiting for the pilgrims, no special welcome, and I liked that, it seemed more authentic to me, as if no one cared about our arrival. I walked through the outskirts of the city mingling with passersby, noticing the metal scallop shells embedded in the sidewalk that guided my steps. I was filled with excitement as I saw the traffic signs indicating how to access the historic center of Santiago, even though I was not arriving in the city by car, but on foot, and moreover, for the first time in my life.
It was almost two o'clock in the afternoon when I reached the old town. Suddenly, a group of people started applauding me from the other side of the street ("Come on, cheer up!" they shouted at me). They were the gang, including David and Isidro, already showered and groomed. Since they had arrived at eleven in the morning, they had had time for almost everything and now they were waiting to go together to collect the Compostela.
I reached the goal alone. During those days, I had fantasized about arriving at the Plaza del Obradoiro accompanied by the sound of a bagpipe. In my daydream, I anticipated the pleasant emotion of having achieved it. I imagined that in the blog I would describe it by saying something like: "...and then it seemed to me that all the bad things of the journey—the blisters, the tiredness, the heat, the snoring, the top bunks, the pre-cooked meals, and even the Xunta hostels—all had been worth it for that incomparable moment when one enters the Plaza del Obradoiro."
And indeed, when I was close by, I heard the bagpipes. But just as I accessed the passageway leading to the square, the bagpiper who plays there in exchange for some coins stopped to take a break. The first thing I saw when I entered the esplanade was pilgrims lying on the ground on their backpacks, gazing at the cathedral facade. In the center of the square, I turned around and did the same: I unfastened the straps of my backpack, let it fall, and sat on the ground leaning against it. "That's it," I told myself. "It's over." I stayed like that for a while, resting, looking at the cathedral and the people. I sent a message to my wife informing her of my arrival. I kept an eye out for anyone I might know, but I didn't see anyone. Where could they be? It was as if they had vanished after a dream. Some were taking group photos, laughing with happiness, I also saw some tears of emotion and impending goodbyes. I needed someone to take a picture of me. There was a Korean man who was also alone and, very kindly, offered to take it for me. I wondered if he was the same person who spilled the bottle of wine in the restaurant in Triacastela and to whom I didn't offer my help. I sent the family the typical photo with the cathedral facade behind me. Then, not knowing what else to do there, I headed to the hostel.
Following the recommendation that Toni gave me some time ago, I went to the Seminario Menor hostel, a former seminary for priests converted into a huge hostel for pilgrims, located in a green area not far from the old town. I treated myself to staying in an individual cell, which for me, after a month of shared dormitories, was quite a luxury despite the monastic austerity of the room, consisting only of a bed, a sink with its mirror, and a small table with a chair. I had regained my privacy! Something as simple as having an outlet just for me or the freedom to turn off the light whenever I wanted at night. Not to mention not hearing snoring or waking up before dawn.
No one was waiting for me, so I had all the time at my disposal. After shaving, showering, and putting cream on my feet, I didn't wash the clothes or, therefore, hang them out to dry. I returned to my cell, locked the door, and lay down on the bed to take a nap.
The first thing I did in the afternoon was go to the Pilgrim's Welcome Office, located on a street near Obradoiro Square, to have my credential stamped for the last time and to receive the Compostela. It was around five o'clock, so I hurried because I knew there would be a lot of people. And indeed, when I arrived, I found a long line that extended through the galleries surrounding the central garden of the house. The line exceeded the length of the corridors, and as if it were the entrance to a crowded event, there were poles with tape to organize the rows of people in a back and forth motion. As I joined, I greeted some familiar faces, but I didn't speak to anyone. The impatient sighs so characteristic of these situations could not be heard; it was a calm and I would even say happy crowd.
After almost two hours, it was finally my turn. On a monitor, they were indicating the number of the counter (out of a total of seventeen that were open) to go to when a bell rang. In front of me, a young woman went to counter number two, and at that moment, counter number one became available, so I waited for the imminent call. But it didn't happen immediately because the official openly stared at the girl who had gone before me. Then the bell rang, and I jumped. Nervous, when I got there, I handed my credential to the employee. He handed me a form to fill out with my information and answer the questionnaire. They asked for my profession. What was it? I wrote "Programmer," and as soon as I did, I realized that it couldn't be more true, even if I didn't practice it, what else did I spend more time on in my life?
—So, should we fire Lopetegui or not?
—"How?" I asked, looking up from the paper, confused.
But it wasn't me the man was talking to, but to the security guard who suddenly appeared behind me with bored steps. In any case, he didn't answer me (maybe he didn't even hear me), so I looked down at the sheet again while he continued discussing with the guard the complicated future that lay ahead for the still then coach of Real Madrid.
Reason for the pilgrimage? I checked the box "Spiritual." I returned the questionnaire. The official consulted something on the computer, I assumed it was the correspondence of my name in Latin. Then he wrote it with a black marker and, adding the date, he handed me the long-awaited Compostela while congratulating me in a formal manner. He didn't even look at the stamps on my credential.
I left the counter telling myself, "how nice they are after all, not charging you anything." But before leaving, they made you pass by a stand where they sold the official cardboard tubes to carry the diploma rolled up inside. Two euros. And I paid for them, of course, everyone bought them, it wasn't a matter of taking the precious Compostela home in any way among the dirty clothes in the backpack.
It was past seven o'clock when I dropped onto a bench in Fonseca Square, right next to the cathedral. I called my wife. There was a lot of activity in the street, the restaurant terraces were filling up. I saw a group of Italians pass by and, shortly after, another group of Germans, all of them were pilgrims I had encountered sporadically during the journey and only now saw them gathering by country to celebrate. The Camino had definitely come to an end. When I finished the phone call, I realized I was starving and thirsty, and behind me was a pizzeria, just what I needed.
Inside, they seated me at an individual table in front of the open door of the restaurant. Still, it was discreet enough for me not to feel like I was being punished. Neapolitan pizza and a beer. While I was having dinner, I watched the people passing by the little square. I was already having coffee when I saw two women who looked familiar from the road. They also recognized me and decided to come into the restaurant. We greeted each other. Their faces seemed very familiar to me, but I only clearly remembered passing them earlier that day, on our late arrival in Santiago: both in their fifties, one of them was walking with great difficulty while the other kept stopping to wait for her.
They sat down, took off their shoes, and ordered a pitcher of sangria. Shortly after, I had finished and, as I was about to leave, I hesitated for a moment, but in the end, I approached them to wish them once again "buen Camino," this time in their lives. They were Canadians and congratulated me for having achieved it as well.
- Are you still following Finisterre? - she asked me.
—No way —I replied.
And then he raised his hand and, showing me his palm, said:
—Us neither. High five.
I bumped into them, first one and then the other. And I said goodbye to them forever, as if saying a "see you later", smiling inside and thinking that, without a doubt, this was the best part of the journey.

Here is where I wanted to get to. In the background, you can see the towers of the Cathedral of Santiago (in the picture, they are only hinted above my head). I share the joy of these two giant bronze pilgrims, who are indeed wearing a cape and carrying a staff. More than any other, this is the photo I wanted to take.
Santiago de Compostela
At night, I stayed awake until late in my room. Since I was the one deciding when to turn off the light, lying in bed, I took the opportunity to take notes and calmly write the texts that accompanied the day's photos.
The next morning I woke up at eight feeling rested. I resumed my habit of shaving and showering in the morning as soon as I got up. After a month, this was also a novelty. I dressed in my casual clothes and went out walking through the very long corridors of the old seminary. After the area of individual rooms, you crossed the shared dormitories and common rooms, with shoe racks full of boots and indoor clotheslines loaded with clothes to dry. It was like being in a hotel inside a hostel, or the other way around. As I walked through the corridors, I passed familiar faces that I greeted, but now I felt embarrassed to stop and talk. It was as if I no longer belonged to that world that had been mine until just a few hours ago.
I headed to the old town for breakfast. I received a message from my wife in which she attached a screenshot from the Pilgrim's Reception Office that read: "Yesterday, Monday, 1034 pilgrims arrived in Santiago." "And one of them was you," she added. In the shop window of a craft store, I saw some earrings with a beautiful design shaped like a scallop shell. I already had her gift.
Around eleven o'clock, I approached the cathedral. There were many people, tourists and pilgrims, both from the Camino and from organized trips. I got in line to access the main chapel to embrace the figure of the apostle Santiago. It so happened that I fell right in the middle of a group of retirees from some Spanish region, I had them in front and behind me, and they were making a lot of noise. Not only them, the commotion was general and, from time to time, through the loudspeakers, silence was requested, reminding us that we were in a temple and there were people praying. Then, for a minute or two, people held back, but soon they forgot and the noise returned. The line was moving very slowly and we were getting nervous because at twelve, in half an hour, the pilgrim's mass was going to start. I noticed the lady behind me, who was pushing me with her purse. In the end, I had to tell her:
—Ma'am, you are pushing me!
—Oh, son —he replied.
I stepped aside to let her pass. But immediately, the retirees behind the lady took advantage of the gap left by her to gain ground and position themselves at my level. Now it was me who had to push them sideways to stand up and not be left out of the line. I was getting annoyed. In the end, I decided that I would embrace the Apostle on another occasion and left the line to go down to the crypt, where his tomb is located. Fortunately, there was no need to wait here, although the flow of people was continuous. I looked towards the urn containing the remains, but I was more focused on not keeping those who came next waiting, so I didn't pay much attention. I left there and went to sit on a bench to wait for the mass to begin.
It turned out to be quite monotonous. By my side, a German pilgrim of a certain age (with boots, surely she had just arrived in Santiago that morning) was falling asleep during the sermon: she leaned towards me and I felt her weight on my side, until just when she was about to rest her head on my shoulder, she would shake herself and, waking up, straighten up again. I was watching the funny little hands that intermittently peeked out behind the figure of Santiago on the altar (they were the hands of the person hugging him at that moment). I was surprised that they kept letting people in during the liturgy.
I assumed that the mass would end without further ado, but at the end of it, the priest announced that the botafumeiro was going to be swung. I wasn't expecting it, supposedly they no longer did it except on special days or if the corresponding fee was paid, something that large groups agreed to. The main priest said, "You can sit down." And then not only did none of those standing sit down, but the rest of the people got up from the pews while getting their phones ready to take pictures. Indeed, it was quite a spectacle.
I had the afternoon left to do what I had to do before going back home. The next day, at Santiago station, I was going to take a train (the Intercity La Coruña-Hendaya) that in ten hours, would leave me directly in Zumarraga, just a few meters from where it all began. Funny how things turn out, under normal circumstances, I would have considered this long train journey a hassle; however, now it seemed to me the most comfortable and fast option.
I went to the city's expansion and bought Santiago cakes for the whole family. Santiago was a city with a lot of movement that Tuesday afternoon, in the commercial streets there were no longer pilgrims, and I myself, going shopping and going in to take a look at the Follas Novas bookstore, felt like just another city dweller.
At the last minute, I returned to the vicinity of the cathedral to visit the Pilgrimage Museum. I walked through the rooms that explained the history of the Camino de Santiago, but what caught my attention the most was a temporary exhibition of photographs. It was titled "Walkers," and in it, its author, a photographer named Tino Martínez, displayed portraits of current pilgrims. Below each image, there was a brief text in which the person portrayed explained their story in a few lines.
In the same sample, there were also another series of landscape photos, in black and white. In one of them, among undulating fields, there was a dirt road that forked, and in the background, a walker could be seen continuing down one of the two branches, moving away from the other option that had been left behind. As I observed it, I remembered that when I left home, until the last moment, I hesitated about the exact day to depart. I was considering several possibilities. Initially, as long as it didn't rain, it didn't matter if it was a day earlier or a day later, the decision depended solely on me. And at that moment, looking at the photo in the exhibition, I felt a certain vertigo thinking that if I hadn't left precisely on the day I did, I wouldn't have met the same people I met or lived the same experiences. Just one day earlier or one day later and, for example, I wouldn't have crossed paths with Toni! The story would have been different. The path taken would have been another, an alternative one, like the one left untraveled in the image before me. However (and this truly puzzled me), after completing mine, it seemed impossible to me that things could have happened differently than they did. This and no other was my story.
       Epilogue
Two weeks after returning from Santiago, after reuniting with the comforts of being at home and quickly getting used to them, I started to miss the Camino. After a month of uncomfortable walks and hostels, returning to my reality was tough for me. Definitely, I had also become captivated by this experience.
Returning on the train, something curious happened to me. The Intercity that was bringing me back was already in Vitoria, therefore close to Zumarraga, where I was eager to arrive to embrace my wife, who was waiting for me at the station. I was lost in thought, looking out the window, when suddenly I saw a little boy, about three years old, holding his mother's hand and waving goodbye to me from behind the turnstiles at the platform, quite a distance away. It wasn't until I realized that he wasn't waving to me, but to his father, who had boarded the train and settled a couple of seats away from where I was. The train started moving and we crossed through the new neighborhoods on the outskirts of Vitoria, full of apartment blocks for sale. Many apartments for sale. And then I remembered that I was still unemployed. Along with the unexpected pang that these thoughts gave me, I was overwhelmed by the worry that was actually behind them: the question of what I should do next to occupy a place again, a matter that I had put on hold when I left for Santiago. What overwhelmed me was realizing that as soon as I got off that train, I would lose the identity I had enjoyed for the past month and return to uncertainty.
Although it seemed that with the trip I had done nothing but avoid the problem, at the same time I believed I had achieved something important. The happiness of reuniting with my wife, my family, and my things was joined by the excitement of having made myself visible to my surroundings. They had followed my blog with interest, where I believed I had shown myself. There was the proof that, despite everything, I could function, because from what I had shared, it could be deduced that I was alive and all I was looking for was a path that would allow me to continue. But I needed confidence.
During those first days, I felt the pleasure of being the protagonist. I couldn't stop telling my wife details of the things that had happened to me. One of my brothers told me that every day, after putting his children to bed, he dedicated a few minutes to the blog, it was like following a novel, a few photos accompanied by brief texts that, with the little time he had, he read with pleasure. My other brother told me that he had enjoyed getting to know the Camino de Santiago from the inside and that he felt like doing it, if it weren't for work getting in the way. My father, during our weekend meeting, asked me questions that I happily answered and recalled the anecdotes that had made him laugh the most.
But after this injection of self-esteem, in a few days things went back to where they were before. Still, on some other occasion we talked a bit about my adventures, but then nothing, as naturally life continued and I, not finding anything else to offer, returned to my usual silence. And with my silence came back the painful feeling of failing again. I even felt ashamed of everything I had shared on the blog, maybe it was all just nonsense after all. It was then when I started to miss the Camino.
I had to write this book. Perhaps I could prolong the communication. I would be lying if I said that during the journey I hadn't thought about writing it and that the material I was accumulating on the blog, as well as the notes in my notebook, were not ultimately aimed at this project. But now it was clear that I had to dive in and get started. I had no other choice. Just as when I embarked on the Camino the goal was to reach Santiago, now I was considering starting a new uncertain adventure that would take me several months with an equally clear objective: to write a book about my experiences and also about myself.
I had already tried to carry out other writing projects before and I had always crashed. It had been too hard for me, with excessive work and uncertainty for the confidence I had in myself. But now I had a guide or foundation that consisted of the material I had gathered, something like the help provided by the Camino with its signage and infrastructure so that the inexperienced can travel it.
So I set out with a similar approach to the one I had followed during the pilgrimage. I would wake up early and after breakfast, I would sit in front of the computer to go through the stage I had planned to write about that day. I would spend the morning on it, until reaching the hostel where it was time to eat. Then I would go for a walk in the mountains for a while, and in the afternoon, I would shave, shower, take care of practical matters, read, and go to bed early at night. And so every day, with a routine as if I were walking the Camino de Santiago. Certainly, insecurity haunted me, the critical voice inside my head would say: "Who do you think you are trying to write a book? You better give it up and do what you are supposed to do." Sometimes that same voice would rebel against me and manifest physically, draining my strength and forcing me to slow down: as if my foot had become inflamed. Other times, lack of confidence would simply knock me down on the couch: as if I couldn't walk due to the pain of blisters. But upon recovering, I would always resume the journey, because both the path and the method were already established to help me finish it.
So, by writing about the journey in this way, I also returned to that intense experience that the Camino de Santiago was for me. And now that I have completed it, I can't stop looking for other ways to take it up again.
