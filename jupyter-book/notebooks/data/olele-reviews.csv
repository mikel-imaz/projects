0,"Carolinaon Nov 1, 2022",5 out of 5 stars,As usual the quality is sturdy yet elegant and the style is exquisite! The small hand fan matched the description perfectly. I'm fully satisfied and will now be able to cool myself easily in the office and on the train whilst looking very smart.
1,"Amy Annetteon Sep 3, 2022",5 out of 5 stars,"I bought this fan to bring to tango and swing dance events, and it is gorgeous! After a shipping snag outside of their control, Karmele provided fantastic communication and customer service to make sure the fan was delivered safe and sound. It was worth the wait!"

12,"Michelleon Aug 4, 2020",5 out of 5 stars,"I love this fan!
It‚Äôs just the perfect size for me. You wouldn‚Äôt believe how hard quality fans in different sizes. 
The fan is absolutely gorgeous! The fabric, staves(? I believe they are called) good and solid. No wobbling here. 
I‚Äôll probably order another. I don‚Äôt need it, but want to have a backup. Lol"
13,"Eni Aon Jul 18, 2020",5 out of 5 stars,"This is the most beautiful and exciting fan I have ever bought. Everybody ask me where I got it! It‚Äôs strong, of excellent quality and with the exact same wax fabric used for a dress I bought in west Africa last year. I will regularly be buying from Olele going forward."
14,"Jazyon Jul 2, 2020",5 out of 5 stars,I wanted a small fan with a plain fabric for semi-formal events like weddings or funerals. This fan was beautifully made and packaged very well. The size is perfect for slipping into a small handbag or clutch. Very happy with my purchase.

17,"Friedrichon Mar 22, 2020",5 out of 5 stars,"I was looking for the perfect fan for a man like me. Then I found Karmeles shop and this wonderfully beautiful accessory. And I was thrilled with him in a split of a second. Blue is my favorite color and the pattern immediately made me think of a night sky shining with thousands of stars. Bingo! Hit! It had to be! Karmele made the fan very clean and simply perfect. He is delivered in a very nice and fine dark blue leather pocket. So now I can keep him safely at all times. An absolutely perfect combination, in my opinion. I can't wait to use him on a sunny spring day. We had it yesterday, but with 5 degrees and cool wind... I am absolutely certain, that we will have warmer temperatures very soon. Now I wish Karmele continued success and that she and all her loved ones stay healthy. Kind regards, Friedrich"

I am waiting to receive news from the people to whom I gave it and I will enter again to put my review of the product, although I can already imagine that it will be in line with the excellent quality that I have perceived throughout the process so far.

I am not a user, but without a doubt these fans and their designs will be one of the favorite resources for my most personal gifts!

Bless you!"

46,"veradumont2on Apr 7, 2019",5 out of 5 stars,"I purchased 3 fans.  A black and dark ribbing, blue with red ribbing and a lovely African print.  
The fans are wonderful, and I am already using them.  I loved also the scent they have. It is a detail I didn't expect but appreciate.  It's wonderful and fresh scent as I use them.
Olele is wonderful!!!! Thank you for your patience and attention working with me."

I far prefer them to the French fans I own - each of Karmele's fans is unique.  Her wonderful fabrics can be combined with different colored wooden staves, as you choose.  She has made up several fans for me that were not posted and will show you what it will look like before making it up.  MANY thanks, once again, Karmele."

Sent very quickly.

Thank you very much!"
88,"Catherineon Aug 14, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,"Karmele makes the most wondrous fans I've ever seen.  The fabrics; woods; combinations of the two are all unique and very sophisticated.  This time, I ordered a smaller fan for a petite friend as well as another one for me to use, myself - I'm often overheated.  So Karmele's fans are a gift to everyone who gets to see them in use - and everyone else loves them, too.
Many thanks, Karmele - I will order again.
P.S. These fans arrive - in their own beautiful cases - FAST!"
89,"mariatwell1on Aug 11, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,My fan arrived earlier than expected and is absolutely gorgeous!  It came in time for me to use at an outdoor theatre production and got rave reviews from my girl friends.  So worth it!
90,"Kittieon Aug 11, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,"My second fan from this shop as I sadly lost my first.  :(  This one is also lovely and I love the extra clip to ‚Äìhopefully‚Äì prevent the same tragedy from repeating itself.

95,"VCon Jul 20, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,This is a truly gorgeous fan!!! And Karmele is absolutely wonderful to work with. Thanks again!!!
96,"Suzanneon Jul 6, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,Very beautiful fan - love it! thanks again and love the case that it comes in. It will go well with many of my tango ensembles!

98,"chrobbeon Jun 27, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,Fabulous!!
99,"Catherineon Jun 26, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,"This fan is made from a Japanese fabric - unlike the other two fans I ordered at the same time - and I love it that Karmele has provided the information to know what the pattern signifies.  The fabric is quite compelling to my eye in both colorways offered; I bought the brighter colors simply for summer use.  The way the fabrics are matched with their wooden staves and leather sleeves is extraordinary - Karmele's fans are truly incomparable.  I feel that I am carrying a small work of art with me when using one of Karmele's fans - others, on seeing them, agree.  MANY thanks, Karmele, for the beauty and comfort you have added to my days."
100,"Catherineon Jun 26, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,"Karmele very kindly made up for me a fan from an earlier pattern: showing me how it would look in advance.  It - like the other 2 fans I purchased - is simply gorgeous.  And her fans are very sturdy, unlike some others I've used and worn out; these fans are of the highest quality.  And unique patterns.  Plus the wonderful leather sleeves make them easy to carry.  I am a fan (ha ha.)  I really will be buying more from this shop and couldn't recommend it more highly.  Besides everything else, Karmele answers inquiries quite promptly and makes one's order up rapidly: your fans are in your hands before you know it!  Thank you again, Karmele."
101,"Catherineon Jun 26, 2017",5 out of 5 stars,"What a beautiful fan!  Fantastic fabric and staves; exceptionally well made!  This fan is a pleasure to use and receives comments whenever I am using it.  Karmele's fans are by far the best I have ever carried.  The fabric was somewhat differently placed on my fan in this pattern but is equally gorgeous.  And Karmele very kindly sent me a picture of how my fan would look before making it up for me.  I purchased three fans this time and will be back.  Many thanks, Karmele.  Oh - and did I say? - each fan came with its' own custom leather sleeve, and arrived remarkably quickly."

148,"SamanthaMGon Dec 6, 2015",5 out of 5 stars,Beautiful fan.  Love the craftsmanship and the vibrant colors of the wax prints.  We have an early X-mas present exchange on one side of my family and purchased the fans as gifts for an Aunt and two cousins and they were well received.  All three ladies were delighted with their gifts.
149,"SamanthaMGon Dec 6, 2015",5 out of 5 stars,Love it beautiful fan meant as a gift and my cousin loved it.

156,"SamanthaMGon Aug 19, 2015",4 out of 5 stars,Love the great quality of my fan.  The fabric is cute and fun and I like it but I don't love it like the wax print fabric.  My daughter is 7 and she likes my fans so this one will probably go to her and keep my other fans safe.
157,"SamanthaMGon Aug 19, 2015",5 out of 5 stars,Beautiful wax print is vibrant on both sides.  I use this as more of an every day fan.  I think it looks good when I am wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  Keeps me cool.
158,"SamanthaMGon Aug 19, 2015",5 out of 5 stars,Colorful and well made.  Not flimsy like other fans I have purchased.  I use my fans almost every day and they work and look beautiful  I have several and the wax prints are colorful on both sides.
159,"Laviniaon Aug 12, 2015",5 out of 5 stars,"The fan is beautiful, it looks exactly as in the pictures (of course, the pattern will be placed differently on each fan), and once you have it in your hands, you really perceive the great quality.

The customer service is absolutely fantastic!

For patterned fabrics like this one, you can also contact Karmele, the maker, and ask her to send you a picture of the actual fan she plans on sending you, so that you can see if the pattern placement is ok for you.

I would really recommend these fans for a refined and classy gift.
