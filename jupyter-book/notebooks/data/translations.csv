"There is no such thing, at this stage in world history in the United States, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not a single one of you who dares to write your honest opinions and if you did we know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I get paid every week to keep my honest opinions out of the newspaper I'm associated with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things and any of you who would be foolish enough to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If my honest opinions were allowed to appear in an edition of my newspapers, within twenty-four hours, my occupation would already be gone. The business of journalists is to destroy the truth, openly lie, pervert, demonize, bow at the feet of the rich, and sell their country and their race for their daily bread. You know it and I know it, and how crazy is this to toast an independent press? We are jumping clowns, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.","There is no such thing, at this stage in the history of the world in the United States, something like an independent press. You know it and I know it.

"I know a few things about reading when it comes to Filipinos. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, they read in English, even though they commonly speak in an indigenous language every day. The Philippines is very aural-oral when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, however, some comics and other literature in Tagalog for the masses. Many Filipinos don't really want to read in English as it may not appeal to them, so they rarely read but instead watch television, videos or movies, most commonly in the indigenous language. I suspect that Roman letters do not appeal to some Filipinos. Tagalog is no longer written in the ancient Baybayin script, but the Unicode standard preserves the syllabograms. Tagalog literature is not yet very extensive, as is the neighboring Indonesian literature. English is like a pink fizzy soda, while Tagalog is like a yellowish-brown cassava cake. (Some French have expressed that Tagalog is more like a gray shark in the sea. But I could imagine some Italians equating Tagalog with squid ink spaghetti. Maybe Tagalog is like the Spanish ""ham of pata negra"" , an expensive delicacy.)","I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipinos.

"Three hours later, the king was wandering around the castle, looking for something to entertain himself. ""Fucking, I'm so bored,"" he complained in exasperation. ""The children are at school. Gwo is at work. Impa is at the hospital. Ganon—"" Suddenly, the king heard an incomprehensible scream, turned around and saw Fari rush past him. ""Damn, Fari, what was that?!"" ""Go to hell, your Majesty!"" Fari screamed at the top of his lungs. ""Wow... I see you're PMSing as usual,"" the King continued to murmur dejectedly. ""Damn, I'm fucking bored. There's nothing good on TV. Nothing good online. Nothing good to eat."" About to leave the dining room, his eyes were drawn to a single jar of cinnamon on the table. There was a spoonful of cinnamon conveniently on the side. In a more rational state, the King would have been reasonably suspicious of it, but now he was so exhausted from boredom that any chance to be relieved of it for a minute would feel like a blessing. ""I wonder what ground cinnamon tastes like,"" he said nonchalantly and popped the spoon into his mouth.","Three hours later, the king was prowling around the castle, looking for something to entertain himself with.

"As far as I understand, despite my little knowledge, here in Venezuela one adapts to the mentality and social order that prevails, therefore the individual must live between opportunism, poverty, manipulation and superficiality. Perhaps it is a characteristic of the Latin idiosyncrasy to behave in delicate situations as in the book <Chronicles of a Death Foretold> by Gabriel García Márquez, everyone knows what is happening but no one raises their voice or even if someone deigns to speak out, I would not receive support. Only enlightenment through education could put an end to the ignorance that plagues the people, and from which many other evils arise. However, it is implausible to expect a government to propose encouraging values ​​that go against their interests, since it is better for them to keep society ignorant so they can manipulate it easily.","As far as I understand in spite of my little knowledge, here in Venezuela one adapts to the mentality and social order that prevails, therefore the individual must live between opportunism, poverty, manipulation and superficiality.

"Well, of course the people don't want war. Why would some poor oaf on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best thing he can gain would be to come back in one piece? Naturally, the common people do not want war; Not in Russia, not in England, not in America, not really in Germany. That is understood.

"The most merciful thing in this world is, in my opinion, the inability of the human mind to relate all its contents to each other.

The sciences, each striving to advance in its own direction, have caused us little harm until now, but the day will come when the gathering of so much dissociated knowledge will open before us such terrifying panoramas of reality and the frightening position that we occupy it, that we will go crazy because of this revelation or we will flee from the deadly light, to hide in the peace and security of a new age of darkness.","The most merciful thing in this world is, in my opinion, the inability of the human mind to relate all its contents to one another.

"The next morning, Link woke up at seven o'clock, refreshed and full of anticipation. ""Caramba!"" He reached out lustfully and pressed the button on the top of the king-faced alarm clock.

"To solve the Palestine problem it would be necessary for the Palestinians to abandon the so-called Palestinian Authority and gather in a common political front to defend the rights of all Palestinians, including refugees and their descendants, who wish to return to Palestine.

"A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him naked and beat him and left, leaving him half dead.

"The task of establishing Utopia in the galaxy was not pursued without friction. Different types of races tended to have different policies for the galaxy. Although war was now unthinkable, the type of fighting we know between individuals or associations within the same state was common. There was, for example, a constant struggle between planetary systems that were primarily interested in building Utopia, those that were more concerned with making contact with other galaxies, and those whose primary concern was spiritual.","The task of establishing Utopia in the galaxy was not pursued without friction.

That is why it is very common to find people who do not litter in other people's bathrooms, because they are embarrassed that others can hear or smell what they are doing.
